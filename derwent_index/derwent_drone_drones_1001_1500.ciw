The third detection is performed by utilizing a pixel intensity value that is less than pixel intensity threshold or an initiation event with a pixel intensity value that is less than the pixel intensity threshold.
   USE - Method for recovering filtered image data by an imaging system (claimed) by using lookback in a host platform (HP). Uses include but are not limited to a a digital camera, infrared camera, optical camera, video camera, and infrared video camera for being mounted in a helicopter, aircraft, drone, ship, boat, vessel, tank, truck, and motor vehicle.
   ADVANTAGE - The method enables utilizing pixel intensity thresholds in image sensor systems for reducing acquired image data to manageable amounts, and setting such thresholds in over-consumption of the power supply resources, memory resources, or processing resources so as to improve image sensor system performance capabilities, so that an initial, coarse filtering provided by the pixel intensity thresholds rapidly reduces the quantity of image data stored in the first memory component. The method enables utilizing a lookback so as to provide effective filtering of noise or irrelevant data by use of a relatively high pixel intensity threshold while maintaining capability to recover initiation event data, where backward looking completion of the threat track and recovery of the initiation event data allows a system to identify a type of the tracked threat, a range of the tracked threat, a speed of the tracked threat, a launch location of the tracked threat for later neutralization or avoidance, or combinations for providing enhanced threat avoidance and countermeasure response.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The initiation event is one of a rocket launch, a muzzle flash, or a missile launch. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for an imaging system.

The drone thread is repeated by first re-capturing images when exist command is not issued.
   USE - Method for demonstrating game e.g. three-player pursuit-evasion (PE) game theory by hardware demonstrator (claimed).
   ADVANTAGE - The robustness is improved, by integrating temporal information and multiple target associations between target robots and robot templates. The execution duration is set for the robot controls, to provide sufficient time for performing the tracking-by-detection process and for conducting the delay compensation. A three-player PE game is constructed to model the conflicting situations such as pursuer robots trying to minimize a distance to the evader robot and evader robot maneuvers to maximize the distance. A number of markers can be configured with each robot, to achieve optimum balance of location accuracy and tracking robustness. The makers are robust against illumination change, state change and/or camera projection. The robustness of robot detection can be improved, e.g., by integrating temporal information with the detection score of each candidate region of interest (ROI) region.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a hardware demonstrator device for demonstrating a game theory.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a flowchart of a multiple-thread process of a hardware demonstrator.

AB    NOVELTY - The apparatus has a microphone which receives a sound signal. A sound card records a digital sound sample of the sound signal. A sample processor processes the digital sound sample into a feature frequency spectrum. The drone sound sample is processed into a drone sound signature. The broad spectrum matching is used to compare the feature frequency spectrum to the drone sound signature. The drone sound signature corresponds to a flight characteristic of a drone (304). An alert is transmitted on matching the feature frequency spectrum to one of the drone sound signatures.
   USE - Apparatus for detecting drones.
   ADVANTAGE - The use of broad spectrum matching enables an entire frequency spectrum of tones emitted by a drone to be compared to a database of drone sound signatures for accurate and precise drone detections and classifications. The drone detection devices provide an adaptive learning system that automatically updates other devices when new drones are detected. The feedback prevents the sample processor from issuing an alert for subsequent feature frequency spectrums that match the drone sound signatures associated with the false-positive detection.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a block diagram of a drone detection environment including a sample processor and a management server.

AB    NOVELTY - The system has a control system for generating and sending a launch signal to a trigger activation device to launch a projectile from a remote location when change in a point of aim is effectuated by an aiming system. The aiming system is adapted to move a gimbaled robotic apparatus mounted on a static platform or moving platform and a projective launching device i.e. rifle (102), in-synch with a point of aim indicator to automatically adjust the point of aim of the projectile launching device to a point of impact coordinate that corresponds to the point of aim indicator.
   USE - System for sighting a projectile-launching device i.e. rifle (claimed) such as bolt action rifle and lever action rifle, used with a remote controlled unmanned transport vehicle (TRV) for various applications. Uses include but are not limited to an all-terrain vehicle (ATV), an aircraft, a marine vehicle and an unmanned drone, for law enforcement swat teams, survey and/or scouting personnel, professional hunting guides, game wardens and sporting enthusiasts.
   ADVANTAGE - The system can be aimed at a confirmed target (CT), so that combination of global positioning system (GPS) coordinate of the projectile launching device, a digital compass bearing of respective point of aim coordinate (POAC) and precise distance to the CT can aid an authorized personnel to automatically locate a precise confirmed target coordinate (CTC) of an intended target from a remote location. The system provides GPS/CTC features to prevent friendly-fire accidents from occurring. The system automatically deciphers CTC of a soldier as a friendly target coordinate if the CTC is equal to the GPS coordinate of an allied soldier and/or vehicle in the event that an allied soldier accidentally aims at another allied soldier. The system can be wirelessly and/or cryptically operated from remote locations, so that an operator can be out of harm way of enemy fire without allowing weapon remote operations from being detected by enemy troops. The system adjusts a riflescope without need to remove arms or hands from the projectile launching device by a shooter while maintaining concentration, shooting posture and scope sight picture.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The aiming system is selected from one of a variable-magnification optical component, an auto-focus component, a night-vision sensor, an infra-red (IR) sensor and a thermal imaging sensor.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a side view of a portable aiming unit mounted on a bolt action rifle.

AU GHOSHAL A
AE REEBEEZ INC (REEB-Non-standard)
GA 201619461X
AB    NOVELTY - The system has a combustor (120) that exhausts gases to a thermoelectric generator and emits radiation and remnant heat into the thermophotovoltaic generator. The thermophotovoltaic generator includes an emitter having a first layer that contains platinum, a metal mesh, a metal foil, a photonic crystal and a second layer containing rare earth oxide and further includes one or more photovoltaic cells that generate electricity. The thermoelectric generator electrically connected to a direct current (DC)-DC converter, includes a heat exchanger that absorbs heat from combustor exhaust.
   USE - Hybrid propulsion system for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) (claimed) or aerial craft such as drone to perform reconnaissance, launch weapons, or monitor battle situations in military applications.
   ADVANTAGE - The overall efficiency of a UAV is increased by implementing the improved propulsion system. The safe landing of aerial vehicle without damage is achieved by the ground based controller, since the battery provides power to motors, when the fuel supply within fuel tank gets depleted by use. The frequency upconversion for radiation from combustor is desirable because the quantum efficiency of converting photons to electrons by one or more photovoltaic cells is increased, thereby increasing the efficiency of the one or more photovoltaic cells.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows the block diagram of an aerial vehicle comprising a hybrid solid-state propulsion power system.

AB    NOVELTY - The apparatus has a sound card (322) for recording a digital sound sample of a sound signal. A sample processor (324) processes the digital sound sample into feature frequency spectrum and processes drone sound sample into drone sound signature. The sample processor uses broad spectrum matching to compare the feature frequency spectrum to the drone sound signature corresponding to a flight characteristic of a drone and conditioned on matching the feature frequency spectrum to one of the drone sound signatures and transmits an alert.
   USE - Apparatus for detecting drones e.g. unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and unmanned aircraft system (UAS).
   ADVANTAGE - The apparatus utilizes broad spectrum matching to enable entire frequency spectrum of tones emitted by a drone to be compared to a database of drone sound signatures for accurate and precise drone detections and classifications. The apparatus facilitates a crowd-sharing component, thus increasing a number of available drone sound samples available to make detection. The apparatus allows drone detection devices to provide an adaptive learning system that automatically updates other devices when drones are detected. The apparatus utilizes feedback to prevent the sample processor from issuing an alert for feature frequency spectrums that match the drone sound signatures associated with false-positive detection.

AB    NOVELTY - The system (10) has control and guide units (C, V1, V2) for controlling and guiding flight of a first series of drones (D1) such that each of the drones flies internally in a closed environment (Z), and for controlling and guiding flight of a second series of drones (D2) such that each of the drones flies internally of the closed environment and, is cyclically positioned at a storage warehouse (M) to pick up a product from the warehouse, transfer the product and position the product at inlets (01-05) of packing lines (LC1-LC5).
   USE - Sector concerning product transfer system for being located in a closed industrial environment for packing and transferring products i.e. food products such as biscuits, wafers, and pasta, in packs/containers of a production line. Can also be used for transferring medical products/articles such as vials, trays/nests for containing syringes, cosmetic area, healthcare, tobacco, and tissues.
   ADVANTAGE - The system can simply and effectively pick up the products, which are supplied in an outlet by relative production lines and transfer the products to an inlet of packing lines so as to carry out the packing internally in relative packs or containers. The system can be designed so as to enable a constant and continuous picking-up of products reaching the outlets of the production lines independently of the number and the effective production regime of the packing lines and/or eventual halts due to faults/malfunctioning and/or machine down times. The products and articles are light in weight and easy to handle, and reduces overall transferring cost, and ensures that a space between the outlets of the production lines and the inlets of the packing lines is completely free, so that operators can control the process comfortably to move around without impediment.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a schematic plan view of a product transfer system located internally in a closed industrial environment.

AB    NOVELTY - The method involves receiving a stimulus selection from a user through a user interface i.e. graphic user interface (GUI). A hardware-agnostic response selection is received through the user interface from the user, where the hardware-agnostic response selection corresponds to an action to be performed by an electronic device i.e. robot, in response to the stimulus e.g. location stimulus (20a). A hardware- agnostic behavior is produced based on the stimulus selection received and the hardware-agnostic response selection received through a processor coupled to the user interface.
   USE - Method for generating a hardware-agnostic behavior of an electronic device e.g. robot (claimed), utilized for crop surveillance, for close-up spotting of irrigation or pest problems and for spraying pesticides to affected regions of the crop. Uses include but are not limited to domestic service robot, industrial robot, military robot, toy robot, wheeled robot, walking robot and drone i.e. unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV).
   ADVANTAGE - The method enables using an application program interface (API) underneath the user interface to translate behaviors inputs and outputs into API calls and commands specific to particular robots, so that a user to is allowed to port brains among different types of robot to robot without knowing specifics of the robot commands while avoiding costly and time- consuming operations.

AB    NOVELTY - The method involves obtaining (1740)a path that encloses the position of the target. A path rate for the autonomous vehicle to move along the path is determined based on the velocity of the target. A path position along the path is determined (1750)based on the position of the autonomous vehicle. A change in the position of the autonomous vehicle is determined (1760)based on the path position, the path rate and the velocity of the target. A velocity and a direction of the autonomous vehicle is adjusted (1770)to achieve the change in the position of the autonomous vehicle.
   USE - Method for an autonomous vehicle such as a drones, an unmanned ground vehicle, an unmanned water vehicle or any other type of autonomous vehicle to follow a target. Can also be used to obtain information such as photographs and video of objects.
   ADVANTAGE - The autonomous vehicle following the target and moving to maintain the tracking circle around the target while also moving around the tracking cycle to maintain the particular offset and angle with the direction of travel of the target. A particular offset is preset in a mode configuration prior to mode execution or is set dynamically by repositioning the autonomous vehicle of the target and resetting the offset by user request or automatically on mode activation. To compensate for the inherent latency in the data transfer, the autonomous vehicle use target prediction techniques to determine the anticipated target position and velocity based on the current target position and velocity of the motion tracking device and/or previous target positions and velocities.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a system for following a target.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a flow chart illustrating a method of the fifth target following mode.

An imbalance compensator comprises a movable weight that is operatively connected to a driver. A controller is in operative communication with the compensator, and counteracts effect of the positionable component on the CG by causing the compensator to reposition the weight.
   USE - Gimbal system for being mounted on vehicles e.g. aircraft such as fixed-wing piloted aircraft, pilotless remote-controlled aircraft, hovering helicopter, drone, missile, dirigible, aerostat balloon, rocket, and watercraft such as boat, submarine, and carrier, for forming a duplicate, counterpart, and/or representative reproduction of an object or scene by utilizing a mirror and/or lens. Can also be used for ground vehicles such as parked car, truck, or motorcycle for navigation, targeting, search and rescue, law enforcement, firefighting, and/or surveillance.
   ADVANTAGE - The system improves inertial stabilization so as to facilitate real-time computer control during stabilization, and enable closed loop systems to track and slew-to-cue for ensuring reduction in the size or density of the imbalance compensator for reducing manufacturing and/or material costs, and/or a footprint required for imbalance compensation mechanisms. The system adopts a processor that executes a stored set of instructions so as to receive positional input corresponding to movable components to determine a position of a movable weight to counteract net effect of the movable component for determining an amount and direction of travel required to locate the movable weight to that position, and to output a command to position the movable weight accordingly.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The driver is a stepper motor. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a method for maintaining a CG in a gimbal system.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a schematic view of a gimbal system.

AB    NOVELTY - The system has a processor (102) for combining sensor data from a set of sensors embedded in moving objects. The processor processes the combined data using a spatial statistics model. The processor predicts a future-condition based on the processed data, where the combined data comprises data from a stationary network. The spatial statistics model comprises a gaussian process model, where the moving objects comprise a set of aircrafts, and the sensor data comprises groundspeeds and airspeeds of the aircraft.
   USE - System for providing inference and prediction about large-scale phenomena from sensors for moving objects by a computing system. Uses include but are not limited to a rotorcraft, jet aircraft, propeller aircraft and a drone by a personal mobile device, laptop computer, desktop computer, tablet computer, computer server and a flight management computer.
   ADVANTAGE - The system predicts the future-conditions to enable aircraft to fly with wind, thus reducing travel time and increasing fuel efficiency. The system increases efficiency without costs of additional expensive hardware as the future-conditions are calculated based on available data from existing stationary networks and sensors embedded in existing moving objects. The system achieves the future-conditions to be accurate by increasing the sensor data available to a prediction model, thus improving use of winds by other aircraft.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included for the following:

AB    NOVELTY - The method involves establishing first-order temporal relation between flight control parameters and flight dynamics for a rotary-wing drone. A path of the rotary-wing drone is controlled by estimating course of the rotary-wing drone on basis of explicit discrete time-variant state-space representation of course control of the rotary-wing drone and estimating a position of the rotary-wing drone on basis of the explicit discrete time-variant state-space representation of translation control of the rotary-wing drone.
   USE - Method for controlling a path of a rotary-wing drone for recording audio-visual data (all claimed). Uses include but are not limited to a fixed-wing drone i.e. plane-like drone, rotary-wing drone i.e. helicopter-like drone, flapping-wing drone i.e. hummingbird-like drone and an unmanned aerial vehicle.
   ADVANTAGE - The method enables an operator to transfer part of capacity of decision to the drone so as to control the drone in an easy manner, while optimizing the path followed by the drone to reach a final destination. The method enables facilitating linearization of control problem on basis of first-order-temporal related models to reduce computational load of the method. The method enables the operator to reduce a value to make control of the drone comply with specific needs when using the drone in an environment requiring faster adjustments. The method enables the drone for recording audio-visual data, so that the drone can capture sounds and pictures from a point of a space inaccessible for the operator, while performing complex motions that cannot be conducted by a person with a level of accuracy or without implementing numerous costly and time-consuming additional technical unit.

A power transfer switch (110) connects one of the energy cells to a propulsion motor and electronics of an aircraft (10) such that the energy cells are rotated at time to power the motor and electronics, where the energy cells are disconnected by the switch during recharging.
   USE - System for providing regenerative power for an aircraft to sustain flight. Uses include but are not limited to an all-electric or hybrid propeller-driven aircraft, including propeller airplanes, light sport and ultra-light vehicles and motor gliders, unmanned aerial vehicles, unmanned aerial systems or drones, helicopters, blimps and pusher propeller airplanes.
   ADVANTAGE - The system regenerates/recharges the energy cells that power the all-electric or hybrid aircraft, thus extending energy cell capacity and range of flight and not changing or changing minimally flight characteristics and aerodynamics of the aircraft and reducing weight of the aircraft. The system provides coordinated charging and discharging of energy cells to continuously power the all-electric or hybrid aircraft during flight.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The energy cells are batteries. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a method for providing regenerative power for an aircraft to sustain flight.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a block diagram of an energy cell regenerative system.

AB    NOVELTY - The system has a length of fiber (40) circumscribing an actively cooled fiber spooler (38) and optically connected to an optical power source (20) and to a high power optical coupler (32') connected to a remote mobile platform (18). A power extraction sub-system on the platform includes an array of thermoelectric converters connected to a refractory beam dump and exposed to a cold environment that creates temperature gradient. High optical energy produced by the power source is converted into another form of energy usable by the platform using the sub-system.
   USE - Optical energy transfer and conversion system e.g. for use in running heavy machinery. Used in e.g. conducting mining operations eleven kilometers below surface of ocean at bottom for Marianas Trench, powering fleet of remotely operated lunar regolith harvesters extracting ice on Moon, in offshore oil rig or complex, in a mobile robot laying its own power fiber while it goes to work, on mobile ground and aerial vehicles for military applications, a focused targeted beam which can be used for local theater shoot down applications such as e.g., defending against other drones while not having humans in the area, on mobile ground, underwater, and aerial vehicles for salvage operations e.g., cutting pieces off for removal, and on other mobile ground and aerial vehicles for demolition e.g., collapsing an old and dangerous bridge or building, as well as with wide range of vehicles e.g. autonomous underwater vehicle, autonomous cryobot, exploration and science rover, launch vehicle, and unmanned aerial system.
   ADVANTAGE - The system allows the vehicle to not only allow deviation of the vehicle trajectory from a direct, gravity-driven vertical descent through the ice, but also permit the vehicle to fully invert, eliminating number of systems from the mass of the launch vehicle and it allowing for direct non-line-of-sight communications to the vehicle, possibly for over-ride of the onboard trajectory control or for range-safety termination of the launch. The system provides a viable multi-mission-enabling design that permits re-load of a single vehicle e.g., a planetary robotic exploration vehicle returning to a lander, for subsequent missions while maintaining the heavy elements of the system on the lander. By drilling a new access shaft and lowering a new laser coupler, the vehicle temporarily operating on onboard stored power could rendezvous and dock with the new coupler, activating a fresh spool of fiber carried by the vehicle, and, hence, begin a new period of exploration relative to the new location of the laser power source.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows the schematic view of a variation of an optical long range energy transfer and conversion system.

AB    NOVELTY - The system has a set of input optics for receiving incident radiation along an input optical axis. A first optical sensor and a second optical sensor detect the incident radiation. A reflector is selectively positionable to a first orientation in which the reflector directs the incident radiation along a first secondary axis to the first optical sensor and to a second orientation in which the reflector directs the incident radiation along a second secondary axis toward the second optical sensor. The reflector is rotatable about an optical input axis.
   USE - Multiple-sensor imaging system e.g. pan-tilt imaging system, handheld imaging system and static imaging system, for use in a gimbal system (claimed) used with a vehicle e.g. helicopter such as hovering helicopter, in consumer and military applications. Can also be used for a ground vehicle e.g. car, lorry, motorcycle and tank, a watercraft e.g. boat, submarine and carrier, an aircraft or airborne device e.g. fixed-wing piloted aircraft, pilotless remote-controlled aircraft, drone, missile, dirigible, aerostat balloon and rocket.
   ADVANTAGE - The system allows the gimbal system to enable a payload to be accurately reoriented with respect to a support platform and the reflector to be positioned to allow the system to utilize multiple sensors in multiple locations by redirecting the incident radiation at various angles, so that inertial stabilization facilitates real-time computer control during stabilization, thus enabling closed loop systems for tracking and slew-to-cue and achieving pivotable orientation about nonparallel axes by controlled driven motion of a gimbal assembly, and hence providing pan and tilt movement of the payload in an efficient manner.

TI Wavelength compressive antenna element for antenna array used in surveillance drone in consumer wireless industry, has wavelength compressing layer for compressing wavelengths of signals before signals are incident to conductor.
AU VOSBURGH F
AE PHYSICAL DEVICES LLC (PHYS-Non-standard)
GA 201577003P
AB    NOVELTY - The antenna element (120) has a wavelength compressing layer (126) in contact with a portion of a conductor (124). A terminal connects the antenna element to a circuit. The wavelength compressing layer compresses wavelengths of signals before the signals are incident to the conductor such that the conductor includes dimension that is based on compressed wavelength of one of the signals and bandwidth of the antenna element is greater than bandwidth of another antenna element (140) without the wavelength compressing layer.
   USE - Wavelength compressive antenna element for an antenna array (claimed) used in a mobile platform i.e. surveillance drone, in a consumer wireless industry.
   ADVANTAGE - The antenna element constructs an array type with an element spacing that is reduced in proportion to magnitude of compression without degrading array performance by compressing wavelength. The antenna element uses wavelength compression to increase precision of direction finding or magnitude of anti-jamming by increasing amplitude difference between two element signals, thus enabling accurate calculation of phase shift. The antenna element reduces relative delay between signals from antennas or array elements and reduces dispersion over frequency of a signal, thus increasing effective bandwidth of directional receiving methods. The antenna element ensures that nanofilm coating is made extremely thin to minimize attenuation while providing full compression of the wavelength to pre-expansion of antenna bandwidth.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The wavelength compressing layer comprises meta-material. INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included for the following:
   (1) an antenna array
   (2) a method for receiving signals using a wavelength compressing antenna.

AB    NOVELTY - The planning method involves defining a desired resolution of coverage of the environment, and initializing an achieved resolution of the coverage. An image of the environment is acquired using the imaging system, and the achieved resolution is updated according to the image. A next position and orientation is moved based on the achieved resolution and desired resolution, and the local information of the sensor is distributed to other sensors in the set of sensors using the communication system to optimize a coverage of the environment.
   USE - Planning method for paths of set of sensors in environment, e.g. indoor and outdoor drones, aircraft, or satellites.
   ADVANTAGE - Achieves the desired resolution since the images acquired by the sensors can be combined into an overall image of the environment. Improves the resolution of the imaged area beyond the pre-specified desired resolution since the penalty function penalizes the achieved resolution only when attained the desired resolution.

AB    NOVELTY - The monitoring system has a movement control unit performs movement control of own terminal with reference to the map information stored into a memory based on drone positional information from a drone apparatus (3) and monitoring positional information acquired from an information terminal apparatus (1). A log recording unit records the log of monitoring positional information and drone positional information. A delivery unit delivers log of positional information recorded by log recording unit via a communication network (5).
   USE - Monitoring system for tracking monitoring object e.g. to-be-monitored person.
   ADVANTAGE - The suppression with respect to offender is exhibited and position of the to-be-monitored person set as monitoring object is confirmed. The sense of security is given to the to-be-monitored person since drone apparatus is tracking the movement of to-be-monitored person. Allows supervisors such as parents to always confirm the to-be-monitored person's positional information since log is delivered to the monitoring terminal by the data delivery unit. Prevents giving the to-be-monitored person's information to suspicious person, and improves security since browsing of the to-be-monitored person's positional information and image only of the user authenticated by the authentication unit is attained. Eliminates complicated operation of recovering the drone apparatus and enables tracking of the to-be-monitored person since drone apparatus returns to the house automatically even in case in which to-be-monitored person does not go home at definite period of time. The drone apparatus reduces the processing burden at the side of management server and detects and tracks the monitoring positional information on information terminal apparatus since information terminal apparatus and drone apparatus directly communicate according to the change. Reduces manufacturing cost of the drone apparatus since image analysis is processed at the management server side.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for a monitoring method.

AB    NOVELTY - The system has drones (110-1, 110-2) comprising radio sub-systems (112-1, 112-2) for demodulating and decoding a set of signals e.g. pilot signals (212-1, 212-2) received from mobile platforms (170-1-170-3). Each sub-system modulates and transmits another set of signals to the platforms. Drone switching sub-systems (116-1, 116-2) switch the data received at the drones to a receiving unit selected from one of platforms and drones. The platforms demodulate and decode the latter set of signals received from one of the drones and modulate and transmit the former set of signals to the drone.
   USE - System for providing broadband Internet access to a mobile platform e.g. vehicle (all claimed) such as watercraft, land-based vehicle, submersible, spacecraft and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), and portable device such as handset device and tablet, using a network of drones.
   ADVANTAGE - The mobile platform detects the need for handoff to a different drone and to carry out handoff so as to improve coverage to mobile platforms that see obstruction on path to the drone network and cost efficiently provide reliable Internet access to portable devices. The system sends a pilot signal in a time slot reuse manner, so that a pilot in adjacent cells is sent in different time slots to avoid interference at boundary of cells.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included for the following:
   (1) a method for receiving broadband access through a mobile platform
   (2) a drone apparatus for provisioning broadband access to mobile platforms
   (3) a mobile platform for providing broadband access to a user.

AB    NOVELTY - The method involves predicting (S110) a drone that is to be newly deployed or transferred from another formation and allocates (S120) network connection information to the drone thus predicted. A virtual routing table is generated (S130) that includes the drone that is thus predicted to be deployed or transferred. The virtual routing table is changed (S160) into an actual routing table. The routing table is calibrated and optimized (S180) upon the drone thus deployed or transferred transmitting a control message of the formation routing protocol.
   USE - Method for controlling hand-over in drone network.
   ADVANTAGE - The defective drone is controlled to provide services without an interruption during the copying activities. The network information of the defective drone is stored in the GCS or an adjacent drone to be transferred to the substitute drone. The ground control station (GCS) can control the defective drone to provide services without an interruption during the copying activities and the packets received and transmitted during the copying activities to be stored in the cache of the defective drone.

A positioning angle of the aircraft is determined from the images. Altitude is extracted from the signal. An estimated value of positioning data of the aircraft is calculated by using the estimated distance. The estimated value is compared with a measured value of positioning data such that calculated distance is considered for navigation when the estimated value corresponds to the measured value.
   USE - Method for navigating and piloting an air-drone in an intruding aircraft in a civilian airspace.
   ADVANTAGE - The method enables comparing the estimated value with the measured value of positioning data such that the calculated distance is considered for navigation when the estimated value corresponds to the measured value, thus navigating the air-drone in the intruding aircraft with high safety and avoiding collision of the intruding aircraft.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for an air-drone.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a schematic view illustrating a passing position of an aircraft and an air-drone.

AB    NOVELTY - The method involves receiving a request from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) (134) in flight for approval of an updated geofence envelope. Determination is made that the updated geofence envelope does not allocated and the updated geofence envelope does not interfere with geofence envelopes allocated to the UAVs by a cloud system. A UAV response indicating approval of a request for the updated geofence envelope is generated by the cloud system. The generated response is provided to the UAV indicating approval of the request for the updated geofence envelope by the cloud system.
   USE - Method for authorizing UAVs e.g. drones, unpiloted aerial vehicles and remotely piloted aircraft, and determining geofence envelope by a governmental organization/company.
   ADVANTAGE - The method enables providing a report generation engine to determine performance characteristics identified in a request and to determine a risk assessment score of the performance characteristics to determine a risk assessment indicator. The method enables ignoring failures for purposes of determining a risk assessment score if a system determines that the failures are attributed to operator error.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included for the following:
   (1) a computer program product for authorizing UAVs and determining geofence envelope
   (2) a system for authorizing UAVs and determining geofence envelope.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a schematic block diagram of an UAV processing system.

AB    NOVELTY - The drone (10) has a control and command computer (18) for driving drone directional and motorization units and connected to a memory (16) for reading forecasted trajectory, so that the drone is moved along the recasted trajectory. The forecasted flying trajectory comprises a main trajectory and an alternative trajectory that is defined by a sublist of 3D coordinates points. The computer is adapted to read the alternative trajectory in the memory, so that the drone is able to move along the alternative trajectory when the predetermined condition is verified.
   USE - Vertical-take-off landing (VTOL) flying drone i.e. unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV).
   ADVANTAGE - The drone has simple, flexible and accurate synchronization using a low bandwidth without requiring central complex position calculation so as to allow quick and reliable execution of trajectory by the drone in case of emergency, thus reducing risk of collision between the flying drones, and increasing security of the system, while modeling kinematics of the flying drones in real conditions.

AB    NOVELTY - The method involves receiving a sound signal in a microphone. A digital sound sample of the sound signal, is recorded by a sound card. The digital sound sample is processed into a feature frequency spectrum by a processor. A broad spectrum matching to compare the feature frequency spectrum is applied to a drone sound signature stored in a database by the processor, where the drone sound signature corresponds to a flight characteristic of a drone model. An alert conditioned on matching the feature frequency spectrum to one of drone sound signatures, is transmitted by the processor.
   USE - Method for detecting drones such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and unmanned aircraft system (UAS), for commercial endeavors.
   ADVANTAGE - The method enables utilizing broad spectrum matching to enable an entire frequency spectrum of tones emitted by a drone to be compared to a database of drone sound signatures for accurate and precise drone detections and classifications. The method enables facilitating a crowd-sharing component where secondary users contribute recordings of drone sound samples, thus increasing a number of available drone sound samples available to make detection process. The method enables providing feedback to prevent a sample processor from issuing the alert for subsequent feature frequency spectrums that match the drone sound signatures associated with false-positive detection.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The alert includes a text message and an e-mail. The flight characteristics include one of retreating, sideways translating, rotating, hovering, inverting, ascending, and descending characteristics. The drone model includes one of a brand name, a part number, and a rotor configuration. INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included for the following:

AB    NOVELTY - The flying drone has multiple directional units each comprising motor device combined with one propeller, which is linked with main housing by an arm. The arm comprises a first extremity connected to the housing and a second extremity connected to directional unit. The directional unit comprises a motormount (10') adapted to break under a predetermined stress. The motormount comprises a first portion (11') supporting the motor device and a second portion (12') connected to the second extremity. The motormount is made of plastic.
   USE - Vertical take-off landing (VTOL) flying drone e.g. unmanned aerial vehicle adapted for supporting payload elements.
   ADVANTAGE - The motormount adapted to break under a predetermined stress creates a protection for the expensive components such as motor device of the flying drone or other electronic devices such as positioning systems, chipboards. The breaking area allows to not damage the arm because the area connected of the motormount connected to the area may stay entire, and thus the breaking area allows to not damage the motor device. The facility of maintenance and low cost is allowed because of the speed of manufacturing and replacement of component.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a schematic view illustrating a motormount.

AB    NOVELTY - The method involves receiving navigational information for a vehicle to which a radar warning receiver is attached. Aircraft attitude information is combined with range and an angle of arrival to determine a position of an emitter in three-dimension using a computer processor. Navigation data is used to stabilize a three-dimensional emitter position against aircraft position changes. Tracking is applied to successive three-dimensional emitter location estimates to generate track of position for the emitter. The track is used when information from a radar warning receiver is not available.
   USE - Method for determining an angle of arrival in a passive radar warning system for a vehicle i.e. aircraft. Can also be used for a ship, helicopter and a drone vehicle.
   ADVANTAGE - The method enables determining an angle of arrival in the radar warning system that uses tracking to provide more accurate angle of arrival. The method enables mapping the angle of arrival and range from measured body angles to a three-dimensional coordinate system in which modem tracking techniques are applied to improve accuracy and stabilization of measurements. The method enables facilitating batch or other least-mean-square processing to produce immediate solutions at each update. The method enables weighting errors without eliminating fundamental advantage of stable three-dimensional tracking to improve a one-dimensional indicator.

AB    NOVELTY - The method involves receiving a user input device (114) related to a velocity for a vehicle (110) within a drive space (105). The input device is processed with a local motion planner (132) selectively adjusting the velocity based on predefined constraints and presence of neighboring vehicles in the space to generate a trajectory. Motion control signals (138) including the trajectory are communicated to the vehicle. Drive mechanisms are operated in the vehicle based on the signals to move the vehicle from first position to second position within the space for an upcoming time period.
   USE - Method for providing shared control i.e. remote and local operator control, over movement of a vehicle e.g. ground-based vehicles such as two-to-four or more wheeled vehicle, aerial vehicles such as multi-copter and drone and semi-autonomous vehicle such as wheelchair, within a space.
   ADVANTAGE - The method enables allowing the local motion planner to provide local planning of vehicle movements using efficient centralized and/or distributed algorithms based on convex optimization and non-convex search to achieve real-time local planning such that an exact grid-based representation of a map can be used in conjunction with a velocity obstacles framework. The method enables distributing non-convex search within a convex region, so that convex (linear) and non-convex (grid-based) constraints are combined to explore a larger solution space, while keeping the computational cost low.

AB    NOVELTY - The drone has a video camera (14) including a hemispherical-field lens pointing to a fixed direction. A scanning sensor acquires an image formed by the lens and delivers raw pixel data. A windowing circuit (152) receives an Euler angle from an inertial unit (154) to window the pixel data. A servo-control unit dynamically modifies a selection signal in a direction opposite to that of a change of attitude of the drone by a corresponding variation of the Euler angle, and an image processing circuit (156) receives the raw pixel data delivered by an extraction unit as an input.
   USE - Rotary-wing drone i.e. quadricopter.
   ADVANTAGE - The drone provides compatibility with the delivery in real-time of HD-resolution images as a fluid video stream, and provides great amplitude of angle compensation while enabling to compensate for the very fast and high-acceleration displacements. The drone does not cause increase of the space requirement or of the weight of the on-board elements, and provides great simplicity of implementation. The drone allows compensation of all optical phenomena and compensation of the effects of high amplitude and low frequency and low amplitude and high frequency undulations.

AE RAYTHEON CO (RAYT-C)
GA 2015605177
AB    NOVELTY - The method involves lobbing a payload container (50) from an aircraft (120). The payload container is guided towards a target area by adjusting a guide portion (64) of the payload container. The payload container is landed with the payload surviving the landing including deploying a chute (98) following the guiding. The adjusting the guide portion includes deploying a sail, the chute and adjusting an angle of an airfoil.
   USE - Method for deploying payload container from high-altitude aircraft e.g. high-altitude bomber, cargo plane, helicopter and drone. Uses include but are not limited for delivery of food and medicine.
   ADVANTAGE - The payload container can be carried and released in a manner to avoid detection, and/or the payload container itself can be constructed to avoid detection. The additional distance between the payload container and the aircraft is provided so as to minimize effect of aircraft draft on the one or more guide portions. The guide portions can provide for guiding including creating thrust or for producing guiding of the payload container towards a target area without production of detectable thrust. The payload container can be released far from a target area to avoid both detection of the aircraft and to provide the illusion that the aircraft and/or the payload container do not have a planned destination of the target area. The payload is enabled to survive release of the payload container from the aircraft and a subsequent landing.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are included for the following:
   (1) a method of providing a non-explosive payload to a target area; and
   (2) a payload container for lobbing from an aircraft.

AB    NOVELTY - The device (200) has an electromagnetic radiation (210) that optically interacts with a sample (206) to produce sample-interacted light (212). A first polarizer (205) is positioned to optically interact with the sample-interacted light to produce a first polarized light (211). A second polarizer (215) is positioned to optically interact with the first polarized light to produce a second polarized light (217). A detector (216) is positioned to measure the second polarized light and an output signal (228) utilized to determine a characteristic of the sample is generated.
   USE - Optical computing device e.g. integrated computational element (ICE) to determine characteristic such as chemical, mechanical or physical property of sample e.g. wellbore fluid, downhole tool component and tubular in downhole environment (claimed) and in oil and gas industry. Uses include but are not limited to fluid capable of flowing such as particulate solid, liquid, gas, slurry, emulsion, powder, glass, mixture, aqueous fluid, non-aqueous fluid, acid, surfactant, biocide, bleach, corrosion inhibitor, foamer and foaming agent, breaker, scavenger, stabilizer, clarifier, detergent, treatment fluid, fracturing fluid, formation fluid or any oilfield fluid, chemical, rock formation, concrete, solid wellbore surface, pipe or flow line and solid surface of wellbore tool or projectile. Can also be used for surface and undersea monitoring, satellite or drone surveillance, pipeline monitoring or sensors transiting body cavity such as digestive tract.
   ADVANTAGE - The sample characteristics are detected in real-time. The need for designing and fabricating multi-layered thin film ICEs is eliminated. The multiple characteristics of interest are allowed to be analyzed using a single system, rather having multiple thin film ICEs. The multivariate optical computing using polarizers modulates the intensity of sample-interacted light where the polarizers along with other device components, produce a spectroscopic intensity profile that mimics the regression vector that corresponds to the sample characteristics of interest.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for an optical computing method to determine a characteristic of a sample in a downhole environment.

AB    NOVELTY - The system (110) has a distance sensor (112) that couples with a vehicle, and detects several distances of objects along several adjacent scan lines (306). A controller (114) determines a location of an edge of a region within several adjacent scan lines. A controller has a comparator module (308) compares values corresponding to the detected several distances. An identification module (310) is configured to identify the location of the edge of the region according to the compared values.
   USE - System for sensing edge of region used with vehicles (claimed) e.g. harvesters. Can also be used in mowers, snow plows, road graders, loaders, bulldozers, automobiles, tractor trailers, aircraft, unmanned aerial vehicle, drones, cars, trucks, tractor trailers, loaders, robotic vehicles, and forklifts.
   ADVANTAGE - The edge sensing system ensures that the harvester is able to accurately track along the edge of crops, thus minimizing undesirable steering issues including operator error, wandering of the vehicle from the edge of the crops or the like. The harvester accurately and efficiently uses the full width of the header to maximize the harvest of the crops with each pass of the harvester. The measured variation of the cross-sectional area of the crop ensures reliable and accurate yield values.

TI Computer-enabled system for monitoring dispersal of deicing fluid onto aircraft's designated exterior portion by operator, determines operator-efficiency rating based on ratio of volume of dispensed fluid to surface area of exterior portion.
AU WALSH J
AE GLOBAL GROUND SUPPORT LLC (GLOB-Non-standard)
GA 2015476613
AB    NOVELTY - The system (100) has a dispensed-fluid sensor (105) for measuring volume of deicing fluid dispensed from a deicing vehicle onto the designated exterior portion (115) by an operator. An aircraft database (120) stores the surface area of each aircraft section. A computer processor (130) calculates the surface area of the designated exterior portion based on surface area of each aircraft section included in designated exterior portion, and determines an operator-efficiency rating based on the ratio of the volume of dispensed deicing fluid to the surface area of the designated exterior portion.
   USE - Computer-enabled system for monitoring dispersal of deicing fluid from deicing vehicle onto aircraft's designated exterior portion by operator. Uses include but are not limited to a fixed-wing aircraft, a helicopter, a glider, a drone, a rocket, a jet, a jetliner, or a commercial jet.
   ADVANTAGE - The computer-enabled system accounts for wasted deicing fluid, thus potentially prompting corrective action to reduce or eliminate the waste of deicing fluid (e.g., by repairing leaks, improving dispersal techniques, etc.). The operator-efficiency-rating may be used to compare the performance of one operator to another operator, or to compare the performance of one operator to the average operator performance (e.g., the average performance at a particular facility, at a particular time, etc.). Allowing the user to customize the deicing job parameters enhances the system's ability to accurately determine the efficiency with which deicing fluid is being dispersed during a deicing job.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included for the following:
   (1) a computer-enabled method for monitoring the dispersal of deicing fluid from a deicing vehicle onto an aircraft's designated exterior portion by an operator; and
   (2) a computer program for monitoring the dispersal of deicing fluid from a deicing vehicle onto an aircraft's designated exterior portion by an operator.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing is a block diagram showing the computer-enabled system for monitoring dispersal of deicing fluid.

GA 201547907S
AB    NOVELTY - The system has aerial platform switching sub-system for switching data received at aerial platform from set of terminals on ground to another set of terminals. An antenna sub-system at a ground terminal (120) points beam toward specific aerial platforms. A radio sub-system (112) at ground terminal which is provided with a receiver (318) demodulates and decodes signals received from aerial platform. A transmitter (316) modulates ground terminal data and transmits pilot signal through ground terminal antenna which is controlled and processed for forming beam towards aerial platform.
   USE - System used in home and enterprise for providing broadband wireless access communication between ground terminals and network of aerial platforms such as drones to relay internet traffic among different types of terminals. Can also be used in unmanned arial vehicle (UAV), balloon airship and robo-copter.
   ADVANTAGE - The ground terminal antenna sub-system which is used for keeping the beam fixed avoids introducing an additional variable for the drone antenna sub-system calibration process. The multiple antenna apertures of antenna design mitigate the beam scanning loss, and helps reduce the overall size of the antenna fixture. Multiple antenna fixture approach mitigates the issues associated with drone pitch and roll. The calibration reference signal which is sent to portion of the spectrum using a relatively narrowband avoids interfering with regular data transmission sessions and avoids losing system capacity.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for a method for providing broadband internet access using a network of aerial platforms.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a schematic view of an apparatus used for calibrating the drone antenna sub-system.

AB    NOVELTY - The system (112) has aerial platform (130) with a radio sub-system (132) adapted to communicate using a fixed satellite service (FSS) download frequency band from among a set of available bands and an antenna tuned to one or more bands from the set of available bands. The multiple cell sites (110) are adapted to communicate with the aerial platform using the FSS download frequency band and each cell site has hexagonal coverage area (160) with first and second corners. A wireless radio transmitter is located at first corner and a wireless radio receiver is located at second corner.
   USE - System adapted for providing broadband access to aerial platforms such as airplanes, balloons, blimps and drones or Unmanned Aerial vehicles (UAVs).
   ADVANTAGE - The systems and methods for an aerial platform transmit antenna reduces its transmit antenna gain at shorter distances to the receiving cell site to keep an almost constant sum of path loss plus transmit antenna gain regardless of distance between the aerial platform and receiving cell site antenna. The transmissions of the secondary service occur toward the southern direction to avoid transmitting into the main lobe of the satellite terminal antenna. The transmissions to and from aerial platform avoids transmission into the main lobe of satellite antennas. The method reduces the interference that spreads the data over a wider bandwidth, thus reduces the power spectral density and the ROT. The ground terminal radio sub-system reduces the transmit power spectral density by spreading and encoding the data to be transmitted over a wider bandwidth than the data rate. The multiple uplink ground terminal allows transmitters to transmit simultaneously on the same bandwidth in a code division multiple access scheme to improve the bandwidth efficiency.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are included for the following:
   (1) a method for associating an aerial platform to a particular cell site from among a set of candidate cell sites in order to provide broadband access to an aerial platform using communication transmitted on a fixed satellite service (FSS) download frequency band;
   (2) a communication system adapted to provide broadband Internet access to aerial platforms; and
   (3) a system adapted to provide broadband access to a set of ground terminals using at least a portion of a fixed satellite service (FSS) frequency band.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows the schematic block diagram showing a system for providing broadband access to an aerial platform using the downlink spectrum of FSS or DBS frequency bands.

AB    NOVELTY - The endless track drive wheel (100) has cogs, in form of roller shafts (115), axially projecting from each of opposing sides (130,135) of a wheel disk and disposed periodically along a circular path at a radial distance (120) from the wheel disk central axis. Each cog has a cylindrical rolling surface rotatable about a cog axis parallel to the wheel disk central axis. Sum of radial distance of the circular path from the central axis and the radial distance of the cog axis from the central axis is greater than the radial distance of the rolling surface of the disk.
   USE - Endless track drive wheel for track drive system in modular robot, particularly a modular self-diagnostic drone or modular power base drone.
   ADVANTAGE - The track drive system including the drive wheel allows for use of low resistance slip-driven tracks tolerant of variations in track length, providing low friction operation over wide range of track dimensions. Track life may be prolonged because of low friction operation. The track drive system allows the track to continue operating even if damaged and or worn, and also allows the track to be more tolerant of dirty environments, such as sandy and or muddy environments. The self-diagnostic system may simplify the in-field maintenance for operators with minimal training. By providing graphical replacement instructions, in-field replacement by personnel with minimal training may be successfully performed. Percentage of working drones may be maximized by scavenging the self-diagnosed working modules from otherwise non-working drones. The display of only the working aspects of the drone may facilitate efficient drone operation by the user. By knowing what modules are operable, the user may better decide how the drone may be best deployed. The user can be freed to perform another task, as the drone autonomously returns home without need of operator input. Cost of maintenance may be reduced due to interchangeability of modular components. Pulse rate of heart beats of the components may be slowed down to improve battery lifetime. By using a payload interface, drone may need not be upgraded as new payloads are made.

AB    NOVELTY - The method involves controlling flight of first and second unmanned aerial vehicle such that the unmanned aerial vehicles are kept at the different distances. The location of a group centroid of the unmanned aerial vehicles is varied with time as the unmanned aerial vehicles move over time. The group centroid is a geometric center of a collection of points. The first location of the group centroid is determined at a first instant in time. A determination is made whether the first location of the group centroid is within a tolerance distance of a first preset location.
   USE - Method for dynamic swarming of airborne drone such as unmanned aerial vehicle for reconfigurable array.
   ADVANTAGE - The drones are maintained to be within the swarm sphere region by sensing the distances between each pair of drones in the group and requiring that the distance between any two drones never exceed the diameter of the swarm sphere. The drones are allowed to perform surveillance over nonoverlapping regions while maintaining the group centriod to be within the tolerance distance third distance of a first predetermined location.

AB    NOVELTY - The drone apparatus (100) has an air vehicle assembly (150) securely positioned within an enclosure assembly (120). The drone apparatus is also operational in various modes (110), including a flight mode (112) and a ground mode (114).
   USE - Drone apparatus e.g. for use as toy or entertainment indoor or outdoor model. Can also be used e.g. for agricultural applications, including monitoring fields and preventing plants from diseases, and different inspection applications for tall buildings, bridges, and plants or even inside pipes or caves.
   ADVANTAGE - The enclosure assembly completely protects the air vehicle assembly from the operating environment or protects the environment from the air vehicle assembly, especially during the landing process or during change in operating mode from air-based movement to ground-based movement. Enclosing the air vehicle assembly allows the users to utilize the apparatus on the ground as well as in the air. Providing a ground mode including a rolling mode allows the apparatus to travel through pipes and other hard-to-access locations. Providing a slipping or jumping mode enhances ability of the apparatus to move in intended direction or path even in presence of obstacles e.g. stones, steps, gaps. When used as a toy or entertainment model, the enclosure assembly may be made spherical to allow for safe flight of the apparatus at home with low risk of damage to objects or injury to kids, as the assembly keeps the propeller from being accessible by hands. Elasticity in the bumps prevents any apparatus damage.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a method for operating a drone apparatus.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows the block diagram of a drone apparatus, and the hierarchy diagram of different types of operating modes.

AB    NOVELTY - The landing pad has a landing platform (2) and a storage compartment. The landing platform comprises a trap door (8) in a normally closed position. When opened, the trap door exposes the interior of the storage compartment.
   USE - Landing pad for unmanned aerial vehicle e.g. drone, delivery. Used for placement in window of residence (claimed), such as in high rise building e.g. condominium, apartment.
   ADVANTAGE - A landing pad with a secure storage compartment or box can be used to provide a convenient and safe place for drones to deliver and/or pick up packages. The landing pad can be configured to fit into a standard window, so that it is more accessible to drones, and less accessible to thieves. The landing pad can also be configured to stand alone, either on a rooftop or in a field. The light emitting diodes or displays allow the landing pad to display information such as clocks, advertisements, and or decorative features. Multiple landing pads can be placed on the same building and networked to create visual designs. By allowing drones to charge at the landing pad, drones will be able to make longer trips and/or carry heavier loads. The storage door on the pad includes a lock to lessen chance that the package is stolen. Various insulating materials can be used to make the landing pad more efficient. The storage compartment is climate-controlled, so as to warm or cool some packages, e.g. pizza, or cool other packages e.g. medications, at least until the user gets home. The landing pad can be configured to reduce wind resistance such as by folding onto the window, so as to prevent it from becoming detached during strong winds. Eliminating the need for external power allows for easier installation of the landing pad in areas without an electrical outlet nearby. The signals being sent between the landing pad and air drones are encrypted to prevent thieves from hacking and replicating them.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a method of delivering a package via an aerial vehicle capable of transmitting a signal recognizable by a receiver associated with a landing pad.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows the perspective view illustrating actual delivery of a package to the landing pad.

AB    NOVELTY - The device (100) has first rod extending into a tubular body adjacent to second rod for forming gap-between the rods in which sample fluid (106) flows. An electromagnetic radiation (110) optically interacts with the fluid flowing through the gap to produce sample-interacted light (112). An optical element (104) optically interacts with the light to produce optically-interacted light (122) that corresponds to characteristic of the fluid. A detector (116) e.g. thermopile, measures the optically-interacted light and generates a signal (124) to determine the characteristic of sample.
   USE - Optical computing device e.g. tuning fork probe, spark plug probe, grooved tubular computing device and modular-type optical computing device, for determining characteristic e.g. C1-C6 hydrocarbon characteristic, salinity, sand content, pH, total dissolved solid characteristic, hydrogen sulfide characteristic, carbon-di-oxide characteristic, asphaltene characteristic, wax amount, saturation amount, resin or water characteristic, of a fluid sample e.g. multiphase wellbore fluid such as oil and gas, in a tubular unit e.g. pipeline or downhole well tubular (all claimed), for an oil and gas industry. Can also be used for determining characteristic of a solid substance or material e.g. downhole tool component, tubular, rock formation, slurry, sand material, mud, drill cutting and concrete surface, in a storage container and for surface and undersea monitoring purposes, satellite or drone surveillance applications, pipeline monitoring applications and sensor system for monitoring a body cavity i.e. digestive tract.
   ADVANTAGE - The device can determine the characteristics of sample in real-time in a compact, cost-effective and stable manner by deriving the data directly from the output of optical element, while ensuring low power requirements, robustness, minimized impact of fluid flow characteristics and ability to place and retrieve the optical system for maintenance or evolutionary upgrades, and allowing passage of other downhole equipments to pass an optical sensor.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The optical element is an integrated computational element. The tubular is a pipeline or downhole well tubular. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a method for utilizing an optical computing device to determine characteristic of a fluid sample.

AB    NOVELTY - The method involves determining a position and orientation of a first electronic device (502) relative to a second electronic device (504) based on three-dimensional mapping of an environment of the first and second electronic devices. Interaction between the first and second electronic devices is controlled based on the position and orientation of the first electronic device relative to the second electronic device. A first augmented reality overlay is displayed at the first electronic device.
   USE - Method for facilitating location-based augmented reality overlays in electronic devices (claimed) such as tablet computers, computing-enabled cellular phones e.g. smartphones, notebook computers, personal digital assistants (PDAs), gaming system remotes and TV remotes. Can also be used for fixture devices e.g. medical imaging equipments, security imaging camera systems, industrial robot control systems, and drone control systems.
   ADVANTAGE - The method enables utilzing a non-individualized density map when insufficient location accuracy is present to accurately report locations of the participating electronic devices or in an event that privacy or security concerns preclude identification of the specific location of the particular electronic device. The method enabels accurately reflecting changes in the position and orientation by changing perspective of the reality overlay to match the changed position/orientation since the electronic device is aware of the position and orientation with respect to the local environment. The method allows the electronic device to provide location-based services by utilizing virtual reality techniques in addition to providing augmented reality-based services that rely on precise position/orientation information maintained by the electronic device using visual odometry and simultaneous location and mapping (SLAM) techniques.

AU HUNTER R O
   SMITH A H
AE LITEL INSTR (LITE-Non-standard)
GA 201538454C
AB    NOVELTY - The location method involves acquiring reference image (302) overlapping target region image, determining number of common subregions (303) in intersection of reference and target region images, determining offsets (304) between common subregions, computing distortion map (305) of target region image over intersection, and remapping target region image (306) to match reference image and generate remapped target region image. The remapped target region image is transmitted to system for monitoring or controlling movement of aerial platform e.g. munition using remapped target region image.
   USE - Precision geographic location method for mapping target region image to reference image for targeting operation. Can also be used for navigation, control, location.
   ADVANTAGE - The ability to effectively attack targets with lighter munitions allows given weapons platform e.g. missile carrying drone to carry greater number of munitions and potentially destroy greater number of targets. The ability to significantly increase targeting accuracy leads to lesser instances where multiple munitions are required to destroy designated target. Enables advantageous tactics of multiple targeting at greater standoff distances with less time spent in high danger zones by improving targeting, and/or location accuracy. Reduces terminal target misidentification/confusion by increasing the effective range of inertially guided munitions and improving the performance of seeker munitions by narrowing their required field of regard. Ensures effectively extending the range of inertially guided munitions whose R95 is dominated by guidance system drift error by minimizing the targeting error.

AB    NOVELTY - The method involves using a computer to calculate an average and a standard deviation for the parameters along a fixed assessment course path. A computer is used to record the parameters of a driver under test or pilot under test as he or she drives or flies a simulated vehicle along the path through the fictional small town or airspace. The variances of the parameters of the driver under test or pilot under test are calculated and recorded from the mean values of the parameters calculated from the drives or flights of the normative drivers or normative pilots.
   USE - Method for using computer to compare performance of driver or pilot under test such as civilian driver, military driver and drone pilot of unmanned aerial vehicle or logistic vehicle against norms of standard.
   ADVANTAGE - Since the driver is enabled to understand about the ability of the vehicle, the accidents are avoided and thus the devastation is minimized. The appropriate information from the vehicle performance is gathered, thus the vehicle dynamics modelB (VDM) parameters are extracted to more accurately model the vehicle performance. The driver is incentivized to minimize noncompliance in both the amount of deviation and duration of the deviation to improve the report.

AB    NOVELTY - The system has an antenna assembly having an antenna housing (14) defining an exit port (20) and provided outside of a battery compartment (6). An antenna (19) is housed in the antenna housing. A vent line (10) is extended from the battery compartment to the exit port to define a passageway through which the gases in the battery compartment exit the battery compartment. A rupture disc (18) between the battery compartment and the antenna housing is provided to be damaged when the battery (4) fails, and the vent line is opened to the battery compartment when the rupture disc is damaged.
   USE - Ventilation system used for venting gases out of battery compartment in aircraft such as passenger airplane, military aircraft, private airplane, helicopter, and drone.
   ADVANTAGE - The satisfactory air quality is maintained inside of the aircraft, and the high temperature or high pressure events are prevented. The adverse effects of the gases on the surrounding components are minimized. The high pressure gases generated as a result of failure of a lithium battery can be efficiently vented outside the aircraft without incorporating another access port through the pressure vessel of the aircraft. The design changes to the current design of the emergency locator transmitter (ELT) and aircraft are minimized. The ELT device and the surrounding structures are at less of a risk of adverse effects and significant damage by decreasing the temperature and pressure respectively. The risk of extraneous damage caused to the ELT or the surrounding objects is minimized. The pressure within the battery compartment is reduced and the temperature of components surrounding the battery compartment is reduced by venting the gases within the compartment.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for a method of forming a battery ventilation system.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a block diagram of the emergency locator transmitter including the battery compartment ventilation system.

AB    NOVELTY - The method involves establishing a send-receive connection between aircrafts e.g. jet, and comparing specific identification numbers of each craft. A master aircraft and a slave aircraft are determined, where the master aircraft is arranged with a highest identification number. A validation of modified trajectory is transmitted from the slave aircraft towards the main aircraft and vice versa. An automatic flight mode of the corresponding aircraft is locked when the aircraft is at specific altitude, and automatic taxiing of the aircraft is locked when the aircraft is at ground.
   USE - Method for decentralized management of air traffic and the traffic of aircraft on the ground. Uses include but are not limited to plane, jet, drone, helicopter and airship.
   ADVANTAGE - The automatic flight mode of the corresponding aircraft is locked when the aircraft is at specific altitude, and automatic taxiing of the aircraft is locked when the aircraft is at ground, thus allowing to flux the air traffic, reducing management costs, avoiding collisions between aircrafts, and reducing insurance charges. The method prevents the planes from being diverted to unauthorized zones and prevents the planes from colliding with the building, thus providing better security and safety for the passengers. The method avoids fear of the passengers, and prevents the passengers from being shocked by the accident.

AB    NOVELTY - The system has a transceiver that receives data about common payload (14) and vehicles. A processor is in communication with transceiver, to compute a path for common payload towards a desired payload destination, to use path and a current payload state to compute a desired payload state, and to use current payload state and desired payload state to compute a respective desired state for each one of vehicles to move common payload along said path. Transceiver is configured to transmit respective desired state for each one of vehicles to respective controller of each one of vehicles.
   USE - Computing system for use in controlling vehicles such as watercraft, spacecraft, land vehicles and aircraft (all claimed) such as air ambulances, aerial cranes, and military vehicles configured to affect positioning of common payload, used in commercial and industrial applications.
   ADVANTAGE - The pilot configurations allow for a reduced number of human operators and can allow a human operator to remain at a safe distance from the lifting procedure. The shared data from multiple surveying drones can provide a real-time dynamic map of the surrounding area allowing the payload to be transported along the most efficient path using the least force. Redundant location estimates of the target from multiple drones reduce the measurement error and variability allowing processor to more accurately determine location and orientation of target.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are included for the following:
   (1) method performed by a computing device for use in controlling vehicles to affect positioning of common payload; and
   (2) non-transitory computer readable medium storing program for controlling vehicles to affect positioning of common payload.

AB    NOVELTY - The method involves fragmenting input data to produce fragments of input data that are self-contained and discrete. The fragments of data are processed at nodes, where distributed experts are worked at the nodes making determinations about the fragments of data or adding details to the fragments of data to produce tagged fragments of data. The tagged fragments of data are reviewed to create definitions for events evident in the tagged fragments of data. Determination is made to check whether the events evident in the tagged fragments of data correspond to the specified activity.
   USE - Method for processing input data in managed workflow to identify an event i.e. recognization of human behaviors combined with interactions with inanimate objects, corresponding to specified activity.
   ADVANTAGE - The method enables maintaining synchronization of input data streams, so that data can be stored outside an input data processing system and sufficient semantic data can be imported into the system to enable the system to use externally stored data in an effective manner.

AB    NOVELTY - The method involves determining anticipated contraction of an electronic document by a printing application associated with a printer device (137) and increasing dimension of information based on dimension associated with a frame of the electronic document or the anticipated contraction of the electronic document. The electronic document is stored in a data store (114), where the electronic document comprises the information defining the increased dimension associated with the frame of the electronic document.
   USE - Computer-implemented method for generating automatically conforming removable adhesive printed labels of items e.g. parcels and commercial products, during shipment of the items from a carrier in a fulfillment center. Uses include but are not limited to a car, lorry, trailer, freight car, container ship or cargo aircraft e.g. manned aircraft or unmanned aircraft such as drone, in a distribution center, a warehouse, shipment preparation facility, and a processing facility.
   ADVANTAGE - The method enables comparing dimensions of graphics or other information within areas or frames-of the electronic document that is printed within demarcations of a sheet against the dimensions of the areas or frames of the electronic document with respect to a ratio by which the graphics or other information can be expanded without transcending boundaries of demarcations of the sheet. The method enables automatically expanding dimension of the content while generating the electronic document in anticipation of automatic reduction in the dimension of the content when the electronic document is printed while maximizing size of the content in an event of automatic contraction initiated by a printer driver and ensuring that the content remains within a demarcation level when the content is printed in the event that no automatic contraction occurs.

AB    NOVELTY - The structure has an opening part for enabling to open and close a ceiling portion of a vehicle. A deflector entrance is formed between a storm drain part and a sealing weather strip. The sealing weather strip is fixed in a front frame that is arranged in a lower part of a deflector. Another deflector is combined in a side of an opening part according to movement of the former deflector. An inner side of the front frame is accepted with the latter deflector. A slider is combined to the lower part of the former deflector and slid along downward direction.
   USE - Folding-type sun roof deflector structure for use in a vehicle.
   ADVANTAGE - The structure separates a sun-roof deflector from the storm drain part through the deflector entrance so as to prevent freezing of the sun-roof deflector according to moisture inflow into the sealing weather strip when a sunroof glass is opened and closed. The structure avoids holding space limit of the front frame so as to maintain height of the sun roof deflector and reduce drone noise of the structure. The structure forms multiple holes in the former deflector along a horizontal direction and combines a deflector weather strip between the deflectors along vehicle width direction so as to reduce wind noise during high-speed traveling of a vehicle. The structure performs arrangement of a hinge joint and the deflectors so as to improve optimum height design of the sun roof deflector according to type of vehicles.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a perspective view of a folding-type sun roof deflector structure.

TI Intensity-independent optical computing device for downhole well system for determining e.g. presence of carbon dioxide of gas in oil and gas industry, has detector for measuring light to generate signal utilized to determine characteristic.
AU PRICE J M

GA 201526375G
AB    NOVELTY - The device (22) has a first polarizer for optically interacting with electromagnetic radiation to produce first polarized light. A first optical element optically interacts with a sample-interacted light to produce optically-interacted light, which corresponds to a characteristic of a sample e.g. tubular (16). A second polarizer optically interacts with the optically-interacted light to produce second polarized light. A first detector measures the second polarized light to generate a first signal utilized to determine a first characteristic of the sample.
   USE - Intensity-independent optical computing device for a downhole well system for determining a characteristic such as presence of certain elements, compositions and fluid phases such as presence and quantity of specific inorganic gases e.g. carbon dioxide (C02) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S), organic gases such as methane (CI), ethane (C2) and propane (C3), higher hydrocarbons, saline water, dissolved ions e.g. Ba, chlorine (CI), sodium (Na), iron (Fe) and strontium (Sr), p.H., density and specific gravity, viscosity, total dissolved solids and sand content, of a sample such as multi-phase wellbore fluid e.g. oil, gas, water and solids, downhole tool and rock formation (all claimed), tubulars, slurries, sands, muds, drill cuttings and concrete, in an oil and gas industry. Can also be used for surface and undersea monitoring, satellite or drone surveillance, pipeline monitoring and sensors transiting a body cavity such as digestive tract.
   ADVANTAGE - The CPU station sends signals through links to program the first and second polarizers to rotate to an azimuthal angle necessary to produce the appropriate regression vector, thus allowing a simpler optical computing device and an ICE core since the device eliminates design and fabrication of the ICE core. The device can detect sample characteristics in real-time, ensures radiometric correction, reduces impact of component's spectroscopic intensity on optical transmission properties of the ICE core and enables accurate design, fabrication and implementation of the ICE core, so that the intensity-independent computing device require fewer radiometric measurements and calibration schemes, and design and fabrication of intensity-independent ICE cores is realized to a simpler thinner film stack, thus reducing manufacturing costs and time.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The sample is a tubular (16). The first detector is selected from a group consisting of a thermal detector such as thermopile or photoacoustic detector, a semiconductor detector, a piezo-electric detector, a charge coupled device detector, a video or array detector, a split detector, a photon detector e.g. photomultiplier tube and photodiodes. The first optical element is an integrated computational element (ICE). The first polarizer is a polarization modulator. The first and second polarized lights comprise one of a P polarized light or S polarized light. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for an optical computing method.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a schematic view of a well system with intensity-independent optical computing devices for sample characteristic detection.

AB    NOVELTY - The system (32) has a hopper (52) for storing a traction medium (10). A duct is formed with an opening that is in communication with the hopper to supply the traction medium to the duct. The duct includes intake (38) at a front end, discharge (44) at a rear end and a baffle (40) located between the front and rear ends to deliver the traction medium into an airflow (48) entering the front end of the duct. The duct redirects essentially horizontal airflow vertically toward ground. The baffle includes a planer structure that is located at about 135 degrees relative to direction of the airflow.
   USE - Traction enhancing system for delivering a traction medium i.e. additive, in vicinity of a tire path of a vehicle i.e. domestic vehicle/motor vehicle. Can also be used for mining lorry and super sized vehicle, drone aircraft and super small robotic controlled vehicle.
   ADVANTAGE - The intake is ridged or flexible and straight, and includes a bell or horn type of form and provides a protruding edge to protect from snow or dust accumulating in a throat of the intake. The traction medium includes coefficient of friction for producing useful results in controlling and stopping vehicles on slippery lower surfaces with low coefficient of friction and disintegrates useful traction controlling function in time controlled fashion. The system consistently and repeatedly delivers sand and gravel to an appropriate location in a front of vehicles tires in a regulated enough way to improve traction and vehicle stability and shorten stopping distance.

AB    NOVELTY - The system has a distributed directional aperture (DDA) system (140) comprising a set of sensors for sensing energy in a media adjacent an entity exterior surface and a set of emitters for emitting signals based on processing of signals generated by the sensors. A telemetry subsystem connects the distributed sensors and emitters. A beamformer subsystem processes the sensor and emitter signals to synthesize directional reception channels and processes transmission channels to synthesize telemetry data emitted by the emitters.
   USE - System for receiving and emitting radiated frequency signals between antennas installed in an entity e.g. aircraft such as airplane, helicopter and drone, ship, ground vehicle or fixed installation, during communication, electronic intercept, defensive electronic warfare and offensive electronic warfare applications (all claimed).
   ADVANTAGE - The system can create desired received and transmitted beam patterns by dynamically selecting and weighting the sensors and the emitters so as to optimize performance of the antennas by minimizing own-platform co-site interference between the sensors and the emitters across multiple mission areas. The system has an aperture distributed across within or under the skin of the entity so as to minimize the effects of the aperture on the entity's structural, aerodynamic or radar observability characteristics, thus providing beamforming capability that directionally restricts reception and transmission through the aperture, and hence improving reception and transmission signal quality and reducing the risk of signal interception or signal interference. The system comprises multi-capability sensors and emitters to provide desired sampling density without compromising entity characteristics such as structural efficiency, aerodynamics, or radar cross section.

TI Method for using three-dimensional feature descriptor with camera pose information, involves storing three-dimensional feature descriptor at electronic device.
AU LEE J C
AE MOTOROLA MOBILITY LLC (MOTI-C)
GA 2015181443
AB    NOVELTY - The method involves determining a first two-dimensional feature descriptor from a first image captured by an imaging camera (114) in a first pose at a time of capture of the first image. The first observation direction of the imaging camera is included in the first pose. A three-dimensional feature descriptor including the first two-dimensional feature descriptor and a representation of the first pose of the imaging camera are stored at an electronic device (100). A second two-dimensional feature descriptor is determined from a second image captured by the imaging camera.
   USE - Method for using three-dimensional feature descriptor with camera pose information, used for electronic device such as tablet computer, computing-enabled cellular phone e.g. smartphone, notebook computer, personal digital assistant (PDA), gaming system remote, TV remote, fixure device such as medical imaging equipment, security imaging camera system, industrial robot control system, drone control system, and multi-player video game.
   ADVANTAGE - The relative position/orientation of the electronic device e.g. tablet computer, and smart phone, is used to support augmented reality (AR) functionality, such as the graphical overlay of additional information in the display of imagery captured by the electronic device based on the relative position and orientation of the electronic device, and based on the position or the orientation of the user's head or eyes relative to the electronic device. The effect of distortion is minimized by implementing a global reset mechanism in the rolling shutter so that all of the pixels on the sensor begin collecting charge simultaneously, rather than on a row-by-row basis. The electronic device can generate AR information that presents various metrics pertaining to the user's progress toward the destination, such as the estimated time needed to reach the destination from the user's current position, and the compass direction of the destination relative to the user's current position, in response to detecting that the user is traveling toward a specified destination identified in the user's text message communications.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for an electronic device.

GA 201514833U
AB    NOVELTY - The method (500) involves receiving (502) data feeds for capturing data corresponding to object obstructed from view in a first three-dimensional stereographic space displayed at an interface. The respective data feeds are selected (504) from multiple data feeds. A second three-dimensional stereographic space including a rendering of object is generated for display at the interface. The portions of the rendering are based on the respective data feed.
   USE - Method for identifying unknown object or occluded object such as personnel, vehicle, ship, submarine, airplane or other vessel within occluded region or space such as terrain surface, building, wall, or weather.
   ADVANTAGE - The system is designed to implement real-time advanced route planning by emulating future positions and clarifying occlusions and capabilities in advance, in order to allow for optimal advanced field positioning to minimize occlusion zones, avoid hazards from, and maximize situational awareness. The field commander is enabled to enhance knowledge of unknown space in another drone to allow real-time sensor coverage of space and transfer data to other extra-sensory perception sharing systems.

A command and control system is configured to communicate with the ground station and configured to change the area in response to control signals from the ground station.
   USE - UAV e.g. quadcopter (all claimed) for collecting and transmitting signal data from wireless communication devices in natural disaster areas, severe impact events and coordinated cyber-attacks for providing recovery effects in airborne telecommunications network.
   ADVANTAGE - The communications from command and control system issues calls and receives guidance from critical infrastructure companies that needs to give warnings of additional impacts to persons in an affected area. The UAV's own guidance and processing system, which is kept separate from the telecommunication system, senses and maintains or changes the vehicle's position and flight as necessary using apparatuses such as a global position unit, accelerometer, and altimeter. The vehicle utilizes its own separate communication system to connect and work with base stations and other unmanned aerial vehicles in its area to maintain the best coverage in the area, with as few gaps and as strong a ground signal. The user directs the vehicle with global positioning coordinates or general commands such as flight area and duration by connecting with the vehicle using its separate communication system. The multiple batteries facilitate longer flight times by preventing one power source from rapidly drained by two separate functions. The swarm logic is programming that enables the drones to communicate with one another, allowing them to react to their operating environment as a unit to increase the efficiency of the network of deployed UAV's and enable a dynamic shift in coverage in the event that of the drones are rendered inoperative for any reason.

GA 201509708K
AB    NOVELTY - The method involves determining a signal at each of color pixels of a spectrum selective element using sum of spectral components. Error associated with the signal at each color pixel of the element, is calculated. Perturbations are performed on each of preliminary values. The error associated with the signal at each color pixel of the element, is recalculated. The perturbations on each of the preliminary values are repeated until the error stabilizes within a predetermined range to assign the stabilized preliminary values to the spectral components in incident light.
   USE - Method for determining spectral distribution of incident light i.e. visible light such as electromagnetic radiation, to increase collected spectral information for detection and sensing of toxic chemicals, explosives, contaminants in pharmaceuticals and food, environmental pollutants, environmental monitoring, biomedical imaging e.g. pathology, reconnaissance and remote sensing through drones, satellites and anti-missile systems.
   ADVANTAGE - The method enables extracting spectral information with high wavelength resolution even when using a small number of wavelength bins, thus allowing cheaper, lighter and efficient optical systems. The method enables transforming an initial set of weights into a set of weights that accurately matches spectral distribution of incident light, thus achieving spectral resolution without decreasing photon throughput and increasing cost.

AB    NOVELTY - The electrostatic aerosol sampling apparatus has at least one corona wire disposed and located within the cavity (11-13) of a chamber (10), and at least one grounded sample collection plate (24) disposed downstream of a portion of corona wire. A high voltage application circuitry generates a corona between corona wire and grounded sample collection plate. An air flow inducing unit induces an air flow through the cavity.
   USE - Electrostatic aerosol sampling apparatus for mounting on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) i.e. drone to collect aerosol sample for e.g. monitoring purposes, as emergency task to assess environmental impact of sundry analytes present in atmosphere such as plume from vent stack, fire, or chemical or biological release at disaster site such as chemical leakage site or nuclear material leakage site.
   ADVANTAGE - The direct mounting of analysis substrates minimizes the handling of analysis substrates to reduce any chance of cross-contamination. Reduces probability of cross contamination since operator does not need to touch the grounded sample collection plates with their hands. Allows size segregation of aerosol and highly efficient collection due to use of multiple stages within the electrostatic aerosol sampling apparatuses. The grounded sample collection plates are configured to enable removal with clean tools, and to prevent cross contamination. The electrostatic aerosol sampling apparatus is small enough to enable deployment by single person, or for electrostatic aerosol sampling apparatus to be carried on aerial platforms. Reduces weight and simplifies the design of electrostatic aerosol sampling apparatus since polycarbonate is used for the material of construction of the body of chambers of the electrostatic aerosol sampling apparatus.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for a method of collecting at least one aerosol sample.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a cross-sectional view of the electrostatic aerosol sampling apparatus.

AB    NOVELTY - The marine vessel has each baffle plate (700) positioned about the perimeter of each buoyant tubular foil (200) so as to protrude into flow of water passing by the foil perimeter. High and low pressure zones are created fore and aft of the baffle plate. A dense stream of supercavitated water is generated immediately aft of the baffle plate.
   USE - Marine vessel e.g. for reconnaissance operations, as well as for delivering or extracting small teams of special forces behind enemy lines. Used as one of surface vessel, submarine, torpedo and unmanned drone (all claimed), an unmanned submersible craft, or as a fleet protection attack craft suited for both military applications and non-military applications, including e.g. security applications such as police, immigration and drug enforcement, public safety such as sea rescues, high speed servicing and re-supply applications such as servicing oil drilling platforms, high speed water taxiing applications, and private pleasure craft applications.
   ADVANTAGE - The vessel such as attack craft is small, fast, highly-maneuverable and heavily-armed, provides a stable platform even when running at high speed in substantial ocean swells to minimize physical stress on the crew and to provide a stable weapons platform, and is capable of remaining on station for a substantial period of time, in order to maintain a reliable defensive perimeter at a safe distance from a naval battle group. The attack craft also provides an effective way for defending against a small boat swarm, by establishing a defensive perimeter at a safe distance from the battle group and permitting the interception, identification, warning and, if ultimately necessary, destruction of hostile boats long before they can approach the battle group. The attack craft is also capable of stealth mode operation, since it has small radar, infrared, visual and noise signatures, making it difficult to detect and target. The craft also provides an effective way for conducting reconnaissance and/or for delivering small teams of special forces behind enemy lines and/or for extracting the same. The vessel is also capable of moving through the water at high speeds, by reducing friction on the foil outer surface. At higher speeds, the lifting foils are capable of lifting the hull of the vessel completely out of the water, allowing the vessel to operate with only its lifting foils in the water, and minimizing drag and increase vessel speed. The buoyant tubular foils house substantially all of the propulsion, fuel and steering systems for the craft, providing the craft with an unusually low center of gravity and permitting the volume of command module to be dedicated to crew, weapons and payload. Hollow tubular structure is configured so as to provide stability at low speed operations while still providing low water friction and an improved hydromantic profile so as to enable speeds of over eighty knots. The use of serially-mounted, counter-rotating propellers permits the propellers to be rotated at higher revolutions per minute, permitting higher speeds to be achieved. These small openings are in communication with ductwork or tubing leading to the outside air, allowing the flowing water coming off the trailing propeller to create a siphon effect, drawing air down for release just aft of the trailing propeller, so as to create an even more dense gaseous envelope for reducing tubular foil friction. The dense stream of gaseous bubbles also enhances the already-supercavitated water coming off the two counter-rotating propellers, so as to create an enhanced envelope of gaseous bubbles for further reducing hull friction as the trailing portions of the tubular foil pass through water. The protrusions can be controlled by elastic bladders which are inflated so as to increase size or drag as desired, or by a mechanical device located at the end of the boom that provides mechanical drag resistance, increasing stability. Creating an air skirt around the hull of the buoyant tubular foil displaces water from around the hull and replaces it with a dense stream of air bubbles, allowing the hull to ride through a cushion of dense foam air bubbles. When the submarine is to approach a shoreline, the submarine can operate on battery power so as to minimize noise and avoid detection. Provides significant improvements in propulsion efficiencies, with the front pulling propeller mechanism biting into virgin water, which enhances the propulsion action of the propeller mechanism, and the front pulling propeller mechanism providing the supercavitating friction-reducing air curtain which reduces hull friction as the tubular foil moves through the water.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a method for moving through water.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows the schematic view of a buoyant tubular airfoil with baffle plates having air injectors around the periphery.

TI System for controlling and maintaining optimum traction between vehicle wheels and surface, in which supply of electric current to electric motor is controlled automatically to correspond to maximum electric current.
AU COX I W
AE BOREALIS TECH LTD (BORA-Non-standard)
   BOREALIS TECH LTD (BORA-Non-standard)
GA 2015002906
AB    NOVELTY - The system has a controller (48) receiving desired vehicle speed and automatically determining a maximum electric current to be supplied to an electric motor (32). The motor translates torque required to drive the vehicle (30) at desired speed and optimum traction to the drive wheels (40,42) of the vehicle. The controller controls automatically the supply of electric current to the motor to correspond to the maximum electric current, and maintains the supply to drive the vehicle at desired speed and optimum traction until the operator inputs a different desired speed to the system.
   USE - System for controlling and maintaining optimum traction between wheels of vehicle and surface on which vehicle is driven. Uses include but are not limited to automobiles, trucks, construction vehicles, military vehicles, aircraft, and trains (claimed), as well as electric vehicle, drones, and unmanned aerial vehicles.
   ADVANTAGE - Improved motor performance and torque accuracy are achieved when temperature correction is performed, preferably after directly measuring temperature using a sensor. Maintaining the current at a level in the range of about 95 to 98 percent of maximum current effectively reduces tire wear and still maintains optimum traction.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are included for the following:
   (1) a method comprising maintaining control of traction between at least one vehicle drive wheel and a ground travel surface;
   (2) a method comprising controlling traction in an electric vehicle;
   (3) a method for detecting a loss of traction in a vehicle driven at a desired speed; and
   (4) a method comprising using an electric motor in a vehicle.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows the perspective view of an electric powered automobile in which traction is controlled.
