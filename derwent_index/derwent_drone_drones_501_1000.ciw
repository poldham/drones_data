AB    NOVELTY - The system has a control system for processing image data to classify each pixel in a set of pixels as representing image data reflected from leaves and non-leaves to identify a subset of the set of pixels that represent leaves. The system processes the pixels classified as leaves to classify the pixels as either direct reflect pixels or indirect reflect pixels. The system processes the reflect pixels separately to classify the pixels as either including a disease or not. The system sends data representing the pixels classified as including a disease over the transmitter to a receiver.
   USE - System for bio-sensing a predefined state of crops for use in information systems for to detecting the shape of tomato or lettuce.
   ADVANTAGE - The system facilitates area to be harvested in a given week that exceeds hundreds of acres, requiring an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to fly relatively in an quick manner while hyperspectral (HSI) sensors collects images of plants with a sufficient spatial and a spectral accuracy to obtain data required to make irrigation, fertilization, detection of diseases and readiness to harvest. The system mixes a priori spatial and spectral information with nested processing of the images or frames segments and sub-segments, thus reducing computational tasks and enabling much quicker delivery of operationally useful information. The system facilitates hyperspectral processing from real time low power processing at sensing edges to fast medium power processing near the sensing edges to slower and higher power processing in data center and matches the needs of a food supply chain, thus increasing usability, scalability, and range of value creation, while reducing traditional bottlenecks in computing power and data transmission.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a schematic diagram of a system for using low cost hyperspectral imaging or HSI sensors on board aerial drones for surveying agricultural fields.

AB    NOVELTY - The flying device (12) has a flight management module (40) to execute a flight plan comprising a stop point (0) in line of sight of the characteristic point, and a position control module to control a position of the flying device within a predefined distance of the stop point. A beam generation module (22) generates a beam to create a symbol (S) designating the characteristic point at an intersection of the beam and the surface.
   USE - Flying device e.g., a drone with propellers, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), remotely piloted aircraft system (RPAS), or helicopter, both for professional uses, including public works and construction, and consumer uses, such as do-it-yourself. Can be used for designating, and possibly marking and measuring, characteristic points in the environment according to a predefined lay out.
   ADVANTAGE - Reduces the risk of errors and the cost of operation. The device can be implemented without any human intervention. Allows marking to be performed by less qualified personnel since the only act to be performed is to apply a mark at the points designated optically.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included for the following:
   (1) a method of creating in a computer a flight plan for designating a characteristic point on a surface with a flying device; and
   (2) a method of designating a characteristic point on a surface with a flying device.

AB    NOVELTY - The power tool assembly (100) has an insulative hot stick having opposing proximal and distal ends. A power tool (102) is supported by the distal end. A user interface (106) supported by the proximal end of the insulative hot stick comprises a communication circuit that communicates with a control electronics circuit through a communication link to selectively activate an electrical load. The communication link comprises at least one non-conductive fiber optic cable that extends along a length of the insulative hot stick between the proximal and distal ends.
   USE - Power tool assembly used in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) such as drones, remotely piloted aircraft (RPAs), autonomous aircraft or semi-autonomous aircraft for use adjacent a high voltage power line.
   ADVANTAGE - The improved powered tool arrangement facilitates power driven maintenance and repair operations adjacent a high voltage power line. The power tool assembly is adapted to protect other effects and enable the power tool to successfully operate proximate to a high voltage power line. The boot combines with the first shield of the housing of the power tool to nominally fully enclose the power tool with a conductive shield thus protecting the assembled power tool from damage resulting from coronal discharge. The repair personnel can be enabled to safely manipulate and remotely activate a power tool to carry out necessary maintenance actions proximate a high voltage power line in a fast, efficient and safe manner. The combined shield generally operates to reduce the magnitude of internal surge currents through the tool in the presence of coronal discharge, thus reducing the likelihood of damage to the batteries. The combined shield supplied by the protective boot can reduce the likelihood of damage to a power tool, enabling automated servicing operations in an environment adjacent high voltage power lines. The protective boot provides safety benefits by ensuring that a removable power source does not become inadvertently dislodged and fall to the ground during manipulation.

TI Navigation system for e.g. guiding cooperative platform relative to non-cooperative object has platform processor that determines at least position of platform in first coordinate system based on characteristics of uniquely coded signals.
AU HOLDER E J
AE PROPAGATION RES ASSOC INC (PROP-Non-standard)
GA 201669846W
AB    NOVELTY - The system has a platform (150) separated from the spatially-distributed architecture (SDA) (110) of antenna arrays (112) and with a second receiver that directly receives the uniquely coded signals (113) transmitted by the SDA, and a platform processor (151) in communication with the second receiver. The platform processor determines at least the position of platform in first coordinate system based on one or more characteristics of uniquely coded signals received by second receiver in response to information from the second receiver.
   USE - Navigation system for determining position and relative motion of non-cooperative object and position and relative motion of cooperative platform and guiding or navigating cooperative platform relative to non-cooperative object. Uses include but are not limited to cars, trucks, trains, tanks, fences, buildings, ship, airplane, and flying drone.
   ADVANTAGE - The jink maneuvers required by conventional systems for coordinate frame alignment are avoided since the SDA determines the position and motion of non-cooperative object and the platform separately self-determines a position, motion and orientation in a common coordinate system. The improved arrangement provides a savings in guidance system resources and reduces time delays in such navigation or guidance systems. No frame alignment is required since SDA is tracking the target in the same coordinate frame that the platform is self-determining its own position and motion, thus saves guidance system resources and reduces time delays. The interferometry improves the accuracy of the process by comparing the relative phase shifts of received signals to provide a very accurate angle measurement.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are included for the following:
   (1) a method for locating at least one non-cooperative object and communicating a location of the at least non-cooperative object in a first coordinate system determined by SDA of antenna arrays;
   (2) a method for self-determining one or more of position and orientation in a coordinate system and controlling a platform; and
   (3) a non-transitory computer-readable medium having executable code stored thereon for execution by a processor.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a functional block diagram of an environment in which a sensor system uses coded signals to guide a platform or platforms relative to a non-cooperative object or target.

AB    NOVELTY - The method involves receiving measurements from accelerometers, where the accelerometers are arranged in distributed diamond configurations. Differential accelerometers measurements are calculated using a processing circuitry. Angular acceleration is calculated using the processing circuitry. The acceleration is filtered to obtain angular velocity using the processing circuitry, where the velocity estimation is isolated from gravity tensor estimation through a constrained filtering technique. Navigation parameters are calculated using an identification technique and the processing circuitry.
   USE - Method for determining navigation parameters of a vehicle such as air vehicle, underwater vehicle, underground vehicle and space vehicle (all claimed), under varying center of gravity (CoG) position and unknown varying gravitational force use with navigation frames i.e. earth centered earth fixed (ECEF). Uses include but are not limited to a missile, a drone, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), a spacecraft, a satellite, a lander, an aircraft and a watercraft.
   ADVANTAGE - The method enables utilizing a norm-constrained Kalman filter to output the angular velocity, thus reducing effect of the estimated angular velocity on the estimated tiny values when calculating the gravity tensor. The method enables neglecting measurements from a faulty ring when rings are included in a system, thus increasing availability and reliability of measurements and estimation of unknowns and making the configuration less dependent on a particular ring which allows excluding a ring's results once it is deemed faulty. The enables solving navigation problem of a vehicle under simultaneous action of varying unknown gravity force and center of gravity position.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The navigation parameters include an inertial position, velocity, acceleration, angular velocity, angular acceleration, attitude, a position of a center of gravity and its rate of change, gravity tensor, and gravitational acceleration. INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included for the following:
   (1) a system for determining navigation parameters of a vehicle

AE SKYFALLX LLC (SKYF-Non-standard)
GA 201668894D
AB    NOVELTY - The system (10) has a parachute (18) arranged in parachute holder mountable to an aerial vehicle (12). A flight sensor in communication with an actuator, detects one or more predetermined emergency flight conditions and transmits an emergency signal when the flight sensor detects one of the emergency flight conditions. The actuator deploys the parachute from the parachute holder when the actuator receives the emergency signal from the sensor. An audible alarm system produces an audible alert sound when the alarm system receives the emergency signal from the sensor.
   USE - Safety and recovery system for unmanned aerial vehicle e.g. unmanned drone or multi-copter.
   ADVANTAGE - The deployment of the parachute out of the parachute holder during an emergency in flight condition can help slow the fall of the aerial vehicle toward the ground and help prevent any damage to the aerial vehicle or other equipment positioned on the vehicle as the aerial vehicle reaches the ground. The autonomous safety system helps reduce the input needed from an operator to actuate the system. A larger parachute can help produce an even larger resistance force to the downward motion of an aerial vehicle during free fall, which can help slow the decent of an aerial vehicle when parachute is deployed. Upward force can slow the fall of aerial vehicle significantly, such that aerial vehicle can potentially fall to the ground at a reduced speed, resulting in the decrease of the potential for any damage to aerial vehicle or any other equipment positioned on aerial vehicle. A feedback verification system can help prevent the deployment of the parachute in situations where the aerial vehicle perhaps falters and then recovers on its own without the need for the parachute to deploy. Also, a slight delay in the release of the parachute during freefall can help ensure that when the parachute is released the aerial vehicle is falling at a sufficient velocity to properly expand or deploy the parachute. The machine learning period coupled with the feedback verification system, which can slightly delay deployment of the parachute in an emergency condition, helps prevent the flight sensor from errantly deploying during short trick maneuvers or short variances in normal flight pattern, where the aerial vehicle recovers shortly afterward. The safety and recovery system is enabled to deploy the parachute when necessary autonomously and without the need for a user transmitted input signal.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a perspective view of the system with parachute fully deployed and slowing the decent of an aerial vehicle.

   KUMAR S S
AE MASSACHUSETTS INST TECHNOLOGY (MASI-C)
GA 201659267L
AB    NOVELTY - The method involves receiving a set of radio frequency transmissions i.e. wireless local area network transmissions, where each transmission comprises a signal transmitted from a second radio node (104) to a first radio node (102) at various locations. A constraint is determined on a range between the nodes from the transmissions, where each constraint is consistent with set of possible ranges that are dependent on transmission frequency of the transmission. The constraints determined from the transmissions are combined to determine an estimate of the range.
   USE - Method for determining separation of two radio nodes e.g. Wi-Fi access point and mobile Wi-Fi device, to estimate sub-decimeter range between wireless local area network transceivers in an indoor environment. Can also be used for smart home occupancy, Wi-Fi geo-fencing and personal drone.
   ADVANTAGE - The method enables addressing the effects of carrier frequency offset between transceivers, unknown packet detection delay at a receiver, sampling frequency offset between transceivers, and multipath propagation between the transceivers, thus improving time-of-fight estimation efficiency, and hence achieving improved time and/or distance accuracy. The method allows the personal drones to maintain a safe distance from a user by tracking owner's handheld device, thus providing accurate range measurements and accurate localization based on accurate range measurements.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The first node is a Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi) access point, and the second node is a mobile Wi-Fi device. The signal comprises an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexed (OFDM) modulation of data. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a software stored on a non-transitory machine-readable media comprising a set of instructions for performing a method for determining a separation of two radio nodes.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a schematic view of an indoor environment in which a distance between two wireless nodes is estimated using transmissions between the nodes.

A dynamically received calibrated spatial location of a target object, the determined parts geometry, the determined task trajectory and the determined collision-free robotic motion trajectory are dynamically transmitted to the robot by the system through a communication network to adaptively control the robot to perform task on the target object while accounting for misalignments of the target object in the work environment.
   USE - Method for adaptively controlling a programmable robot communicated with a drone device through a communication network e.g. internet, wireless network and communication network, that implements Wireless-Fidelity (Wi-Fi) of Wi-Fi alliance corporation for various applications. Uses include but are not limited to a mobile robot, an industrial robot, a service robot, a factory robot and a military robot for welding applications, painting applications, assembly applications and pick and place applications e.g. packaging and palletizing applications, product inspection applications and testing applications.
   ADVANTAGE - The method enables performing continuous monitoring by a camera in a drone device to ensure any variance in the work environment, so that variance leading to a possible collision is instantaneously fed to the adaptive robot control system for determination of the collision-free robotic motion trajectory of the programmable robot, thus eliminating a possible collision of the programmable robot in the work environment.

AB    NOVELTY - The method involves determining (1402) a local motion pattern by determining a set of local motion vectors within a region of interest between a previous frame and current frame. A global motion pattern is determined (1404) by determining a set of global motion vectors between previous and current frames. A separation metric is calculated (1406) based on the local motion pattern and global motion pattern, in which the separation metric indicates a motion difference between the local motion pattern and global motion pattern. An object is tracked (1408) based on the separation metric.
   USE - Method performed by electronic device such as video camcorder, digital camera, cellular phone, laptop computers, tablet device, media player, television, automobile, surveillance camera, robot, aircraft, drones, unmanned aerial vehicle, smart application, healthcare equipment, gaming console, personal digital assistant, set-top box, etc for motion-based tracking of object e.g. pedestrian or vehicle.
   ADVANTAGE - The accurate tracking of the target object within the current video frame is achieved due to the motion-based tracking. The reliable way of comparing the local and global motions and separating them for robust tracking is achieved by the improved method. The region of interest from expanding unnecessarily and losing track of the object is prevented by using the local motion information.

AB    NOVELTY - The GPS receiver (700) has computer circuitry that receives constraints enabling determination of geographical location associated with GPS receiver using number of GPS signals from GPS satellites (712). The computer circuitry calculates pseudo ranges between GPS receiver and GPS satellites at various orbital positions of GPS satellites over a period of time, and determines geographical location of GPS receiver using pseudo ranges and known correlations with respect to previous geographical locations associated with GPS receiver.
   USE - GPS receiver used in system (claimed) for determining geographical location associated with vehicle. Uses include but are not limited to ground vehicle, airborne vehicle such as airplane, helicopter, and drone, waterborne vehicle such as boat or ship.
   ADVANTAGE - Provides ability to determine the geographical location of the GPS receiver using less than four GPS signals when GPS receiver does not have line of sight to GPS satellites e.g. due to mountains, hills, bridges, buildings or any other objects that mask or block a line of site to satellite by determining the geographical location using one to three GPS signals. The constraints reduce the number of unknown variables to be solved by the GPS receiver, thus decreases the number of GPS satellites required by GPS receiver to solve the unknown variables. Allows faster determination of the geographical location by having more GPS satellites.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for a method for determining a geographical location.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a block diagram of the GPS receiver communicating with at least one GPS satellite in order to determine the geographical location of GPS receiver.

AB    NOVELTY - The counter-UAV system (0) has a radar system (1), an electro-optic infra-red (Eo/IR) video camera system (7) and a radio frequency jammer system (8). The jammer system is controlled by a system console (3) to detect a UAV on the radar system. The jammer system also disrupt the actions of the UAV by enabling the RF jammer system to transmit on the discrete frequencies or the spectra of frequencies within a wider band used by the UAV to receive wireless transmissions from remote sources, so as to deny the UAV access to the data on those wireless transmissions.
   USE - Counter-UAV system such as drones, unmanned air systems (UAS), remotely piloted aircraft (RPA).
   ADVANTAGE - The EO/IR camera would scan a greater volume of sky compared to the degree horizontal field of view (HFOV), thus increasing the probability of detection by the EO system and reducing the object acquisition time. The minimum radar tilt angle ensures that ground clutter reflections and ground based object detections are reduced within the radar unit, which prevents unwanted information being presented to the operator on the radar control console. The radar tracker and video tracker unit are both tracking the same object then the information on that same object from both the radar unit and the EO/IR system is combined to improve the object location accuracy and provide both the EO/IR Jammer console and the operator with better object information.

AB    NOVELTY - The electric dispenser (100) has a pressurization system (106) for automatically regulating a pressure level of a gas in a pressurizable space. The pressurization system is configured to take a pressure reading of the gas, and to make a determination if the pressure reading indicates a deviation from a desired pressure level based on the determination to make a decision selected from a list having at least to start pressurization, to continue pressurization, to stop pressurization, or to do nothing.
   USE - Electric dispenser used on vehicle such as a cart, trailer, motor vehicle, boat, robot, airplane, drone etc. for dispensing spray drops or foam for cleaning, treating, coating, etc.
   ADVANTAGE - The electric dispenser system can be lighter, less bulky, and less expensive to produce. The electric dispenser can allow for very tight controls on the amount of pressure used by an operator and minimize the potential for human error. The pressurization can be automatically slowed to ensure full pressurization when the pressure levels are high in the pressurizable space. The retainer and cartridge fits to ensure that excessive fluid does not bypass treatment by the mixing media inside the cartridge. Lower pressure can be safer for users because lower pressure reduces the potential for tank bursts, leakage, and misdirection of high energy chemical streams.

AB    NOVELTY - The system (100) has a network modem in wireless communication with a base station (130A). A sub-system provides multiple data packets to the network modem to be transmitted wirelessly to the base station. The sub-system comprises a video encoder to receive an input video signal and provide the data packets based on the input video signal. The network modem provides network condition information to the sub-system. The sub-system adjusts operating parameter of the video encoder based on the network condition information received from the network modem.
   USE - System for gathering electronic news of events e.g. sporting events, natural disasters and political demonstrations, from remote locations by a reporter of a broadcast company for multiple applications e.g. military, homeland security applications and police applications such as airborne applications with helicopters and drones.
   ADVANTAGE - The system can quickly change video complexity during reporting of a game of some fast-moving sport so as to make allocation decisions based on fresh information. The encoder can calculate a bit rate based on video complexity and last mile data rate information regarding other encoders so as to reduce network congestion.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The network condition information comprises a maximum data rate (MDR) and current data rate (CDR). INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included for the following:
   (1) a method for gathering electronic news of events from remote locations by a reporter of a broadcast company
   (2) a computer-readable medium comprising a set of instructions gathering electronic news of events from remote locations by a reporter of a broadcast company.

AB    NOVELTY - The method involves storing data indicative of a storage location of each of one or more items in a memory. One or more items to be retrieved are identified (810). A data indicative of the storage location of each of the one or more items from the memory is retrieved. A load/unload device is actuated (830) to retrieve each of the one or more items from the storage location. The one or more items are transported (840) to an access port for retrieval from the vehicle. An input is received from a mobile computing entity. The items are retrieved based on the location of the vehicle.
   USE - Method for retrieving items e.g. packages, parcels, bags, containers, loads, crates, items banded together, vehicle parts, pallets, drums, from a vehicle such as a tractor, a truck, a car, a trailer, a tractor and trailer combination, a van, a flatbed truck, a vehicle, drone, airplane, and helicopter.
   ADVANTAGE - The access to at least a portion of the storage locations is facilitated since the robot arm is mounted on a base that travels fore and aft within the vehicle. An item can be more efficiently stored in that location and the automated load/unload device grasps the item from the shelf without the associated shelf activated.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a system for retrieving items from a vehicle.

TI Method for providing access to area of restricted air space for drone by beacon device for applications, involves determining clearance for drone by beacon device to access restricted area based on comparing access parameters for drone.
AU TAVEIRA M F
AE QUALCOMM INC (QCOM-C)
GA 201647296J
AB    NOVELTY - The method involves transmitting beacon signals including access information associated with accessing a restricted area (260a) by a beacon device i.e. wireless communication device (170). Multiple access parameters associated with a drone (100) are received by the beacon device. A signal is transmitted from the beacon device to the drone indicating the determined clearance for accessing the restricted area. The clearance is determined for the drone by the beacon device to access the restricted area based on comparing the access parameters for the drone and the access information.
   USE - Method for providing access to an area of restricted air space for a drone by a beacon device (all claimed) for multiple applications. Uses include but are not limited to airports, airplane flight paths, no-fly zones, buildings/skyscrapers, military reservations, stadiums and private property for performing aerial surveillance, communication relay function and data collection, monitoring weather, deploying commercial and military systems and delivering packages.
   ADVANTAGE - The method enables proceeding additional corrective actions e.g. landing in or moving to a designated area, along a designated path to avoid a restricted area returning to a designated location, preventing takeoff, reverting control of the drone to a third party, restricting usage of the drone while in the area and waiting for a period of time. The method enables combining estimates of location based on received ground-based radio frequency (RF) emitters with position information from a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receiver to provide more precise and reliable location estimates than achievable with either method alone. The method enables reducing frequency of communications between the drone and a server by maintaining local version of database information so as to reduce overhead and traffic load. The method enables an area associated with the beacon to allow access under certain conditions such as allowing drones that belong to an owner of the area, allowing access during certain times, allowing access based on use restrictions and allowing access upon the payment of a toll.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a schematic view of communication links and navigation links in a drone system between a drone and a system component while near restricted areas.

AB    NOVELTY - The evaluation method involves positioning an imaging system in an aircraft, and acquiring an aerial image of at least a portion of the field while the aircraft is in flight over the field. The aerial image is processed to assess variations in the pixels of aerial image. The location (30) of aerial image is mapped to a position of the field on a geographical map.
   USE - Evaluation method for analyzing field to determine, monitor, and predict plant health and growth.
   ADVANTAGE - The prediction is substantially more accurate than conventional yield estimate methods such as counting the yield in random area of the field and then extrapolating this count to predict yield of entire field since yield prediction is based on each individual pixel in the captured thermal image. The additional locations are field checked in order to potentially provide more accurate yield prediction results. The ground inspections are further improved by providing the user with access to a database of images during the physical ground inspection. The software is adapted to communicate remotely with the database, and allow viewing of the images without the need to download the images if the handheld device has wireless Internet capabilities. Allows ability to precisely navigate to the areas of most interest since user is allowed to walk through the field with user's present location shown on top of the image.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for a system for analyzing a field.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a screen shot of a computer software interface suitable for remotely inspecting a field with an unmanned aerial vehicle.

AB    NOVELTY - The method involves determining a location-of-interest relative to an aircraft (100) using a terrain awareness and warning system. A distance value and a bearing value for the location-of-interest are calculated relative to the aircraft. First display data is provided to an electronic display, where first display data causes the display to show an aircraft situation display image indicating the location-of-interest. Second display data is provided to the display, where the second display data causes the display to show the calculated distance value and the calculated bearing value.
   USE - Method for displaying data regarding potentially dangerous terrain or location-of-interest near an aircraft for pilots by a terrain awareness and warning system, weather radar system and a traffic collision and avoidance system. Uses include but are not limited to display data regarding potentially dangerous terrain or ground, hills, mountains, trees, rock formations, buildings and utility/transmission towers near a fixed-wing aerial vehicle i.e. propeller-powered or jet-powered vehicle, rotary-wing aerial vehicle i.e. helicopter, manned aircraft, unmanned aircraft i.e. unmanned aerial vehicle, and delivery drones.
   ADVANTAGE - The method enables using a consistent shape across warnings to train pilots to know and understand representation of an alert shape, thus preventing the pilots from having to waste precious time searching the display for an alert or studying the shape of displayed terrain to determine an area of most immediate concern, while providing an indicator line to generally allow the pilots to quickly identify presence of approaching terrain and to avoid making of impact with the terrain.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included for the following:

AB    NOVELTY - The method involves coupling a load to an arm (600) of a centrifuge by way of a vector-seeking linkage (114) e.g. U-joint, 2-axis gimbal, 3-axis gimbal and cable, where the arm is coupled to a spindle that is rotatable about an axis, and the vector-seeking linkage causes the load to align with a linear acceleration vector caused by rotation of the arm about the axis. The rotatable spindle is rotated about the axis. A set of values generated by a sensor is obtained over time during driving of the spindle.
   USE - Method for separating heterogeneous elements of a solution through utilization of a centrifuge (claimed) in testing operability of an inertial sensor and for subjecting a human to an acceleration vector that the human is likely to encounter during flight e.g. airplane flight, drone flight and shuttle flight.
   ADVANTAGE - The method enables allowing a centrifuge to be more quickly when used to separate heterogeneous elements in a solution when a vector-seeking linkage allows a vial that includes the solution to stay aligned with a separation acceleration vector, thus avoid mixing.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a method for operating a centrifuge.

AB    NOVELTY - The method involves collecting some of exhaust gases during an operation of the internal combustion engine. A turbine is feed with energy of the exhaust gases collected. An electrical current is produced. The maximum principal power (PM) supplied by the internal combustion engine is compared. The storing of the electrical energy generated in energy storage unit is performed. The electrical energy generated is utilized to assist the internal combustion engine to provide the demanded power (PD). The operation of the pilotless aircraft is modified to supply the PD.
   USE - Method of managing power demand to assure operation of a pilotless aircraft.
   ADVANTAGE - The additional mass linked to the use of new equipments is compensated by an improvement in overall efficiency at the level of the propulsion system and a possibility of recovering the drone in the event of an engine problem. The increase in the installed power makes it possible either to carry more fuel in order to increase the autonomy of the drone or to carry a greater payload, more safely. The reduction of the altitude could be accompanied by another action to reduce the power PM demanded such as a modification of the speed if reducing only the altitude of the aircraft would bring the aircraft to an estimated altitude below this threshold altitude.

AB    NOVELTY - The method involves determining control data for controlling a drone (3) with respect to a work machine (1), where the control data comprises three-dimensional destination position coordinates with respect to a three-dimensional reference position of the work machine. A navigation path is determined for the drone, based on the control data. A navigation zone (19) is determined for the drone, based on the control data, where the navigation zone comprises a three-dimensional coordinate range within, which drone movement is permitted, where sensory data comprises one of image or audio data.
   USE - Method for controlling a drone i.e. ground-based vehicle e.g. track type or wheeled vehicle, and marine vessel such as boat, submarine vessel, amphibious vehicle and hovercraft, in a system for use in a work site e.g. mining sites and offshore geotechnical engineering sites such as oil platforms, artificial islands and submarine pipelines. Uses include but are not limited to an articulated truck, asphalt paver, backhoe loader, cold planer, compactor, compact track and multi-terrain loader, dozer, dragline, drill, electric rope shovel, excavator, feller buncher, and a forest machine.
   ADVANTAGE - The method ensures that a docking station can be provided with a quick-release mechanism for allowing the drone to be launched quickly, where a cover can secure and protect the drone when docked and/or enable protection of the connection unit when in the extended configuration and when the drone is undocked. The drone is prevented from being disconnected from and separated from the docking station, where the cover can act as a shield to provide protection from falling objects, dirt ingress and water ingress.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included for the following:
   (1) a work machine for communications in a communications network
   (2) a drone
   (3) a computer program comprising instructions to perform a method for controlling a drone in a system.

AB    NOVELTY - The system has a sensor carrier (100) comprising sensors (128) arranged along length. A deflector (110) controls lateral extension and vertical position of the sensor carrier, where the lateral extension exceeds 25% of length of the sensor carrier, and vertical height above a sea bed is less than the lateral extension of the sensor carrier. The sensor carrier comprises acoustic transponders. The acoustic responders are utilized for positioning the sensor carrier. The sensors are temperature sensors and chemical sensors.
   USE - Sea bed survey system for being towed by a towing body for a remotely operated vehicle (ROV). Uses include but are not limited to a surface ship, drone, helicopter, hovercraft, torpedo, ROTV, AROV, scientific towed equipment, military towed equipment, or surface-, air- or underwater body.
   ADVANTAGE - The system comprises a control unit that is configured to allow locations of the sensor carrier to be controlled to automatically maintain a constant vertical offset relative to a reference point of the system by using depth information derived from water pressure sensors or by measuring the distance to sea surface using echo-sounding, or by measuring sensor carrier tilt angle relative to the horizontal plane using libels or accelerometers, so that the provision of tilt sensors allows for compensation of predetermined or adaptively determined errors in non-tilt sensor output or non-tilt sensor derived signals. The system ensures that electrical power and signals are distributed in balanced pairs using galvanic isolation so as to reduce EMC defects in cross-feed into sensors, and magnetic fields. The deflector allows locations of the sensor carrier to be controlled to automatically maintain a constant vertical offset relative to a reference point of the system.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a sea bed surveying method.

AB    NOVELTY - The three dimensional obstacle course and navigation game kit has a base (40) configured to selectively and detachably secure a hoop (42). The base comprises an attachment structure configured to selectively and detachably secure the hoop. The attachment structure is configured for selectively and detachably securing the base to a fixed object. The hoop is sized to allow a projectile object such as remote-controlled toy aircraft to pass through it.
   USE - Three dimensional obstacle course and navigation game kit for providing recreational game involving the throwing and/or maneuvering objects including paper airplanes, toy aircraft, drones, balls, darts or projectiles through a series of obstacles such as hoops or gates.
   ADVANTAGE - The size of the hoops placed in the playing environments can provide additional challenges to game participants. The suction cups can enable the suction hoop to provide wide-ranging versatility to the number of locations onto which hoops can be hung during the game. The versatility can provide challenge and diversity to the game by allowing the suction hoop to be oriented in nearly any manner. The components can also be shaped and sized to allow an average user to insert and remove the hoop from the base without requiring excessive force. Tracking the positions of the hoops and/or obstacles can aid in calculating a player's score by indicating when the toy aircraft has passed through, over, under, and/or around a particular hoop or obstacle. The computing network can track progress of a player's toy aircraft through the obstacle course, calculate time elapsed and/or score, display time elapsed and/or score during a player's run, and then display the player's final time and/or score along with the player's ranking relative to other players. The computing system can also allow a player to share one or more of his or her time, score, ranking, and videos with other players on the same obstacle course or with other players worldwide.

AB    NOVELTY - The method involves instructing a drone (105) through a self-organizing network (SON) to measure radio frequency (RF) data at a location on path corresponding to a wireless network problem. The data is evaluated at the SON to determine whether the problem is resolved. A scanner profile is transmitted from the SON to the drone, where the profile identifies frequencies to be scanned by the drone to generate the data. An attenuation profile is transmitted from the SON to the drone, where the attenuation profile provides parameters to process data based on environmental condition along the path.
   USE - Method for facilitating closed-loop optimization of a wireless network i.e. SON, for a communication system (all claimed) through a user equipment (UE) using an autonomous vehicle e.g. unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), driverless or self-driving car and tracked vehicle. Uses include but are not limited to a mobile phone, a tablet computer, a laptop, a cell phone provider and a mobile data provider.
   ADVANTAGE - The method enables performing closed loop functions without or with minimal human input or interaction, thus reducing time required to optimize a wireless network without relying on a test engineer to gather the RF data, which is evaluated by a network engineer to identify optimizations for the wireless network. The method enables permitting the drone to process the data to improve performance when the drone informs the SON about identified problems instead of relying solely on an optimization module to discover the network problem.

AB    NOVELTY - The device has a transducer (104) for receiving a signal and outputting a longitudinal wave based on the signal. A wave enhancer (108) is coupled to the transducer, and directs the longitudinal wave into a form having lower attenuation in a medium than the longitudinal wave as output from the transducer, where the signal causes the longitudinal wave to oscillate such that a fuel source of chemical reaction receiving the longitudinal wave is disrupted for reducing or stopping the chemical reaction, and the signal has frequency to cause the longitudinal wave to disrupt fire.
   USE - Device for disrupting physical phenomena e.g. chemical reaction such as fire or isopropyl alcohol flame, by using a longitudinal wave e.g. pressure wave such as acoustic wave, and electromagnetic wave (all claimed). Uses include but are not limited to a vehicle e.g. automobile, aircraft such as airplane, helicopter and drone, train, spacecraft, watercraft, car, lorry and satellite, a robotic firefighting system, server farm, stove, cooktop, factory, vegetation i.e. tree, and a residential and/or commercial property.
   ADVANTAGE - The device can extinguish the fire without use of harmful chemicals, and does not require refilling of chemicals as with a typical extinguisher, thus assuring a higher level of safety to a user.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a method for disrupting physical phenomena by using a longitudinal wave.

AB    NOVELTY - The system (100) has an air heating chamber (110) for receiving inlet air from an air intake chamber (120) and providing thrust through an exhaust chamber (130). A battery powered pulse generator (140) generates a pulsed electrical output signal. An amplifier (170) is arranged for amplifying the pulsed electrical output signal to provide an amplified pulsed power output signal to the air heating chamber, where the amplified pulsed power output signal directly heats the inlet air to generate thrust through the exhaust chamber.
   USE - Propulsion system for use in a jet engine of a drone aircraft or a land vehicle.
   ADVANTAGE - The exhaust chamber can enable thrust to exit the resonant engine after the inlet air is heated in the air heating chamber, so that pressure wave fronts are created during and after the pulsed energy phase to cause more heated air to exit the exhaust chamber than back through the intake chamber.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a method for generating thrust for a vehicle propulsion system to generate thrust for a vehicle propulsion system.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a block diagram of a vehicle propulsion system with a battery powered pulse generator.

GA 201629520X
AB    NOVELTY - The airship has a case portion which comprises a relative annular duct (602) through which air can flow, and relatively aerofoil shape in cross section. A propulsion mechanism provided within the duct is an engine utilizing a propeller closely fitted to the walls of the duct. The engine utilizes counter-rotating propellers smoothens the airflow. A steering mechanism adapted to direct outlet airflow from the engine provides vectored thrust for steering or assisting in the steering of aircraft. An active weight control adjusts the pitch attitude of the craft, motor, fuel and batteries.
   USE - Airship to operate as lighter than air device e.g. drone aircraft in a large elliptical airship of unusual construction.
   ADVANTAGE - The maneuverability of the airship is improved by having the weight of the engine close to the centre of lift, making the airship easier to rotate, as well as preventing the off-axis thrust which causes traditional airships to pitch up under power. Thus delaying or preventing the formation of a turbulent wake and avoiding the significant drag such a wake creates. The overall shape of the annular aerofoil significantly reduces the turbulent wake of the airship. The shape makes flights at higher altitude by reducing the overall drag, and by concentrating airflow to the engine, allowing air breathing engines to operate at higher altitudes. Therefore, an improved airship is provided which improves the aerodynamics, reduces flutter and greatly reduces the parasitic drag of engines, lines, cabins and control surfaces.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a method of configuring an airship.
