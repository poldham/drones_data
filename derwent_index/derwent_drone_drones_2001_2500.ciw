AB    NOVELTY - The nozzle (20) has a collar (200) placed at inside a frame (21) in upstream of a shroud. The collar comprises two side walls (210, 220) assembled in a pivoting manner in the frame. The walls are connected with each other by two transverse rails (230, 240). Each rail is mounted on each side wall in a sliding manner. The side wall comprises panels (211, 212, 221, 222) connected to each other by mobile rotation axles (223, 231). The rails are mounted on one of the panel. The panel is fixed at a downstream end (2110) to the rotation axle integrated to another frame (214).
   USE - Two-dimensional sectioned nozzle for an aircraft (claimed) e.g. drone or unmanned combat air vehicle.
   ADVANTAGE - The design of the collar is moved to deviate gas flow from an engine and carry out a vectorizing thrust in the engine for piloting of an aircraft about its yaw axis in an effective, reliable and easy manner. The structure of the collar optimizes the obstruction in the frame and avoids parts crossing the frame. The dimensions of a section of the collar preserves the vector thorough perpendicular to a geometrical collar at time of steering or swiveling, thus ensuring output identical to that of a fixed nozzle. The components of the collar are integrated within the fixed frame, so that no moving parts are present outside the aircraft, thus minimizing radar signature and heat of the aircraft from a movable nozzle or components.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a perspective view of a nozzle with a mobile collar.

AB    NOVELTY - The method involves buying a scleroderma guani, and storing the scleroderma guani under low temperature. An induced host i.e. drone hatch pupa, is brought. A replacing hols is brought to process chemical coma. The chemical coma is processed under low temperature. The scleroderma guani is inoculated on the inducing host to process an inducing oviposition. The scleroderma guani is transported. The replacing host and a cotton ball are dropped with anesthetic i.e. medical diethyl ether, in a sealing glass utensil.
   USE - Method for breeding an induced scleroderma guani.
   ADVANTAGE - The method limits the replacing host by time when breeding current scleroderma guani, the source is limited, and satisfies the massive demand for the scleroderma guani in production, utilizes the replacing host to cultivate the scleroderma guani after the induced host induces oviposition, improves the breeding production yield of the scleroderma guani, and avoids the influences under cost and time limitation when selection of the replacing host is reduced.

AB    NOVELTY - The system (100) has a drone operator station which is in communication with multiple drone aircraft. Each of the multiple drone aircraft includes a transmitter for transmitting a search signal upon receiving the initiate search signal with the unique code (102). The drone aircraft transmits a search signal (158) over a search area of predetermined size. The search signal increases the search area until the chip is located. The search signals from the multiple drone aircraft form the triangulation data (157).
   USE - System for locating kidnapped individual such as businessmen and contractors.
   ADVANTAGE - The passive transponder is small in structure, so that the detection of transponder within the individual can be difficult. The passive transponder is within communication distance to the drone aircraft, so that passive transponder can derive power from the aircraft with requiring own power supply. The passive transponder is not toxic, so that the usage of passive transponder is not harmful to the individual. The antenna can allow the radio frequency identification (RFID) to receive the electronic signals from the drone aircraft faster than the smaller antenna. The antenna and the supercapacitor are allowed for faster reception of electronic signals from the drone, greater collection of that electronic energy, and faster transmission of the chip's signal to the drone, so that the passive RFID is capable of communication over 300 plus feet.

AB    NOVELTY - The system has a dual receiver provided with antennas (A1, A2). Radiation of the antenna is oriented in direction of an approach zone along an inclination descent axis given with respect to a horizontal plane. The antennas are co-located in a place (P) of a landing area (13) at defined different heights (h1, h2) such that each antenna collects a signal (S1) reflected directly by an aircraft and the signal from same aircraft by reflexion on a ground area located under the zone, and conjoint exploitation of the signals received by the antennas realizes measurement of altitude free of ambiguity.
   USE - Multistatic radar system for an aircraft altitude measurement system (claimed) for realizing measurement of altitude of an aircraft i.e. drone, located in a approach zone of a landing area.
   ADVANTAGE - The design of the system continuously measures the altitude of the aircraft in a precise manner by using the standard antennas so as to allow precise guidance of the aircraft up to the landing area in an autonomous manner to supervise the landing of the aircraft to provide indications for a pilot to land the aircraft to ensure optimal landing of a remote-controlled aircraft without requiring for embarked equipment.

AB    NOVELTY - The engine has a compressor and a turbine rotatably connected to a rotor shaft (30). An enclosure encloses a combustor (80) and forms a cooling air path around the combustor. An aft roller bearing is located near a hot zone of the combustor, where the roller bearing includes an inner race and an outer race, and a set of rolling elements. The enclosure and the rotor shaft are formed in a cooling air passage (48) to direct cooling air from the compressor through a guide vane cooling air passage, through the roller bearing, and into the combustor to provide cooling for the roller bearing.
   USE - Expendable gas turbine engine for use in unmanned anal vehicles (UAV) e.g. small cruise missile and drone.
   ADVANTAGE - The engine passes a portion of the air flow from the compressor into the bearing to cool the bearing races, so that no significant thermal temperature difference between the inner race and outer race of the bearing is developed and avoiding radial spacing between the two race surfaces to increase, thus preventing the bearing from breaking apart, and hence improving the efficiency. The engine includes cages that reduce friction and heat generation, thus increasing bearing life.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a cross section view of a gas turbine engine with cooling air flow paths through a bearing with a rotary cup injector dividing primary and secondary burn zone air flows.

AB    NOVELTY - The method involves demodulating a signal with another signal to form a resulting signal comprising sine curves with respective frequencies. The resulting signal is sampled, and fast Fourier transformation is performed on the resulting signal for the duration of the emission ramp to form the resulting spectrum. Lines in the frequencies are detected in the resulting spectrum. Vector sum of the lines is performed after the re-phasing of the lines with respect to one another. Radar detection is performed by comparing the modulus of the vector sum with a preset threshold.
   USE - Method for detecting and avoiding the obstacle i.e. non cooperative aerial obstacle, using a radar i.e. air-borne radar, of an aircraft (all claimed) e.g. drone.
   ADVANTAGE - The method increases the range of a radar to attenuate or disappear the eclipses related to remote ambiguities while remaining compatible with the requirements of non-ambiguity Doppler. The method enables easily detecting and avoiding the obstacle, without using complementary unit opposite to a classic frequency modulation continue wave (FMCW) type radar. The method enables optimizing the output of the waveform of the radar, and minimizing the noise related to the fault emission for the radar.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a graph representing two wave forms showing an application of the fast Fourier transformation on an emission ramp. '(Drawing includes non-English language text)'

AB    NOVELTY - The system has a container (4) arranged in a cargo compartment of a transport aircraft (AC) and brought from a lifting position to a dispatching position (P2). The container is located within the compartment in the lifting position and longitudinally shifted toward rear of the aircraft in the dispatching position, so that a container dispatching part (7) is located in an exterior of the aircraft by an opening (8) at rear of the compartment. Sliding units are formed to transport a load (3) in the dispatching part or dispatched when the container is in the dispatching position.
   USE - System such as drone and cargo, for lifting and dispatching a load i.e. ammunition such as missile or bomb type projectile, in a transport airplane (claimed) in military application. Can also be used for lifting and dispatching other loads such as troops and/ or vehicle.
   ADVANTAGE - The sliding units are formed to transport the load in the dispatching part or dropped when the container is in the dispatching position, thus ensuring lifting of the load in safe and inexpensive manner without using a safety gear, allowing the system to be easily utilized to any type of transport airplan, and reducing the risk of collision with the transport airplane. The absence of slowdown of the load after dispatching ensures the area of controllability of the missile and starting of the engine. The system avoids the avoids the need of integration of re-acceleration system of the missile.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a schematic side view of a load lifting and dispatching system mounted on a transport airplane in a dispatching position.

AB    NOVELTY - The alternator has an iron coreless winding (10) surrounding a permanent magnet (1) e.g. cylindrical magnet, where supply direction of the magnet is orthogonal to a rotation axis. The winding has turns found in a plane parallel to the plane of the rotational axis. The winding is extended on dihedral angle from the rotation axis lower to 75 degrees, and is radially extended on the distance between the fourth and half of the diameter of the magnet.
   USE - Low power alternator for use with a display device and a battery for an adjustable electric system (all claimed), for lighting a bicycle. Can also be used for a motor less terrestrial vehicle e.g. roller skate, push chair or wheelchair, or a motor less non terrestrial vehicle e.g. glider, paraglider or sailing vessel, for use as a safety light for a luggage trailer or in an electronic toy i.e. friction car, frame, a high output small wind turbine, a mechanical activating pocket lamp, or a charger for a nomad apparatus e.g. portable telephone, and for supplying power to electronic circuits of a reduced thermal model, drone or thermal motor garden tool.
   ADVANTAGE - The configuration of the alternator allows providing high output and negligible stand-by loss while allowing the alternator to have smaller number of simple parts and to have less weight and size.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a top view of a low power alternator.

AB    NOVELTY - The method involves determining space-time transformation based on hypothesis of movement and a geometrical model of an observation instrument for a pair of composed images. Pixels of the composed images are mapped to the transformation. A function of resemblance image is optimized repeatedly until verified stop criteria used for determining the space-time transformation of the pair of composed images after hypothesis of movement. (Incomplete specification, abstract based on available information published by the patent office).
   USE - Method for estimating movement of an observation instrument embarked on a vehicle flying over a celestial body i.e. Earth. Uses include but are not limited to an airplane, drone, helicopter, and satellite.
   ADVANTAGE - The method enables estimating the movement of the observation instrument embarked on the vehicle driven over the celestial body in a robust manner even when the observed scene comprises multiple slightly textured zones.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a flowchart illustrating a method for estimating movement of an observation instrument embarked on a vehicle flying over a celestial body. '(Drawing includes non-English language text)'

AB    NOVELTY - The method involves obtaining one or more craft position data samples for a craft, and identifying, based on one or more of the craft position data samples, any one or more candidate exemplar paths from a repository of exemplar paths each defined using a sequence of spatial data elements representative of a previously determined craft movement path. Path match likelihood is determined for each candidate exemplar path by calculating probability of match between the craft movement path and each candidate exemplar path, and ranking the candidate exemplar path based on relative probability.
   USE - Method for predicting movement path of a craft e.g. manned or unmanned land, airborne or waterborne craft. Uses include but are not limited to an airplane, a helicopter, an airborne weapon, a drone, a missile, a balloon, a ship, a boat, a yacht, a hovercraft, a truck, a car, a tank, and a motorcycle.
   ADVANTAGE - The method reduces the load on operators involved in producing and maintaining recognized air pictures. The method allows matching of tracked aircraft and vessels to exemplar paths to be performed using relatively short track segments, and allows exemplar path match results to be rapidly identified and presented to operators for decision making.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included for the following:
   (1) a craft movement prediction aid system comprising a path monitor
   (2) a pattern matcher adapted to identify, based on one or more craft position data samples, any one or more candidate exemplar paths from a repository of exemplar paths
   (3) a pattern miner adapted to characterize exemplar paths from historical craft movement data
   (4) a computer program code causing a computer to implement a craft motion path prediction method.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a flowchart of a method for predicting a movement path for a tracked craft.

AU HARRIS M M

   GARCIA A M
AE FLORIDA TURBINE TECHNOLOGIES INC (FLOR-Non-standard)
GA 2011F28740
AB    NOVELTY - The process involves passing compressed air from a compressor around a forward end and an aft end of a combustor to provide convection cooling of outer walls of the combustor. Ten percent of the compressed air is passed through a set of stage guide nozzles (58) to cool the nozzles. Cooling air from the guide nozzles is passed through a roller bearing to cool roller elements and inner and outer races of the roller bearing. The cooling air is discharged from the roller bearing into the combustor for combustion.
   USE - Process for operating a gas turbine engine in unmanned air vehicles (UAV) i.e. small cruise missile or drone.
   ADVANTAGE - The process enables maintaining the races at similar temperatures to prevent radial clearance from being developed in the bearing. The process enables preventing the heated cooling air outside the engine, thus improving efficiency of the engine and increasing range and loiter time of the vehicle.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a cross-sectional view of a gas turbine engine with cooling air flow paths through a bearing with a rotary cup injector dividing primary and secondary burn, zone air flows.

AU HOY P D

   BOEING CO (BOEI-C)
GA 2011F24957
AB    NOVELTY - The flight control system (2) includes a control logic that causes the primary aerial vehicle to maneuver laterally to avoid a second aerial vehicle. The control logic predicts a time when a loss of separation between the aerial vehicles will occur, and determines the start time of the lateral maneuver by which the primary aerial vehicle could avoid the predicted loss of separation. The start time precedes the predicted time. Commands are output to control the primary aerial vehicle and begin a turn during start time and then follow a flight path defined by the trajectory.
   USE - Flight control system for an unmanned aerial vehicle (claimed) or aircraft.
   ADVANTAGE - The flight control system has the capability of creating lateral maneuvers and is better suited for a real time processing on-board an aircraft. The system also offers a better guarantee about the miss distance and does not use ground reference turns and instead utilize the wind vector to create inertial referenced turns which makes it easier for the flight controller to follow the commanded route or trajectory. The flight control system also inhibits unnecessary nuisance maneuvers since the time until maneuver execution is maximized, allowing state information to improve and the path change to be canceled if determined to be unnecessary.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included for the following:
   (1) a method of re-routing an unmanned aerial vehicle controlled by a remote pilot; and
   (2) an unmanned aerial vehicle.

AB    NOVELTY - The device has an interferometer provided with two receiving antennas to provide measurement of angle of arrival of target echo, where the arrival angle measurement has direction precision and an ambiguity level. A colored transmission system is provided with two contiguous transmitting antennas (1, 2) emitting two orthogonal codes (E1, E2). A filter unit (40) separates received signals into two signals corresponding to the two orthogonal codes, where another arrival angle measurement of the target echo is obtained by applying a monopulse measurement principle to the two signals.
   USE - Radar device i.e. high angular precision radar device, for detecting air obstacles non co-operative for an autopilot aircraft i.e. drone.
   ADVANTAGE - The measurement retained for the angle of arrival of the target echo has the better direction precision and the angular ambiguity level, thus obtaining precise direction measurement with less ambiguity, or even null ambiguity.

AB    NOVELTY - The device has a storing unit storing predetermined values of a carrier-to-noise ratio, so as to reach rate values corresponding to operating points that are selected for data transmission. An acquisition unit acquires the values of ratio when receiving radio links (103, 104) at maximum power. A deducing unit deduces values of another carrier-to-noise ratio corresponding to the operating points other than current operating points. A selecting unit selects an optimum operating point by the radio links such that other ratio is greater than or equal to the former ratio.
   USE - Device for monitoring radio resources e.g. terrestrial type data processing and controlling device, marine type data processing and controlling device and aerial type data processing and controlling device, of a satellite communication system that is used for controlling and collecting information of missions coming from a drone.
   ADVANTAGE - The design of the monitoring device ensures that the resources can be allocated dynamically to users quickly. The design of the monitoring device allows rapid reconfiguration of usage of the radio resources during a call. The design of the monitoring device enables optimal use of the communications equipments e.g. transponders, on the satellites of the satellite communication system, and ensures digital data transmission from or to the users in a targeted range while improving number of users of the satellite communication system.

AB    NOVELTY - The device has a column antenna (111) including a network and another network (12) of radiation elements for respectively focusing an emission beam and a reception beam in orthogonal elevation and azimuth planes. Focusing of one of the beams is obtained in one of the plane by colored emission followed by formation of the beam. Focusing of the other beam is obtained in the other plane by formation of the latter beam. The emission is realized by grouping sub-networks of antennae at the emission to form a sum channel and a difference channel at the reception based on monopulse technique.
   USE - Radar device for sensing and avoiding obstacles for an aircraft (claimed) such as autopilot aircraft i.e. drone.
   ADVANTAGE - The configuration of the device minimizes number of emission and reception paths ranging from 8 to 12, ensures regrouping of the sub-networks and simplification of electronic circuits and limiting of number of components, facilitates integration of emission and reception antennae on a carrier, minimizes the surface of the radiation panel, and ensures accurate performance for detection of the target at a low speed on the ground clutter. The device is compatible with high range resolution in case of coloration in frequency, with high Doppler frequency, with continuous waveform and with utilization of microwave frequency amplifiers of 2 watts available at a reduced cost. The device maximizes observation time on the target for a given observation cycle duration, ensures simplified detection of the target, carries out colored emission without variable step microwave frequency phase shifter, and eliminates quantification of the phase.

The ladder rail can be extended to full length when in use, or contracted and folded for storage.
   USE - Vehicle-mounted apparatus for conveyance of unmanned helicopter, such as a drone which is used in spraying chemical agents such as agrochemicals.
   ADVANTAGE - The unmanned helicopter can be easily loaded to or unloaded from the loading platform of the carrier vehicle by using combination of a ladder rail, cart, and cart mounting frame. Unloading work is further made easier by setting small inclination angle of the ladder rail between the platform and the ground when the apparatus is in use. The cart mounting frame may include a wheel support rail and a ladder rail storage space underneath the support rail, allowing for compact storage and transport of both cart and the ladder rail without interference between both. By providing a rear end member for opening the ladder rail storage space, the ladder rail can be easily put into or taken out of the storage space. By providing an interlock mechanism, the operator need not separately raise or lower the rear end member. The runner in the helicopter is supported by the runner support body only when the wheels of the cart are settled on the wheel support rail, enabling the helicopter to be stably conveyed. The controller of the main rotor of the helicopter is in front of the cart mounting frame, preventing the main rotor from being damaged during conveyance. The fixing device for the main rotor is detachable with respect to the helicopter body, so as not to obstruct flight of the helicopter.

AB    NOVELTY - The device has a laser distance measuring device with a laser transmitter for transmitting radiations to a target, and a laser receiving device for receiving the radiations reflected from the target. An analyzing device measures delay time of the radiations for measuring target distance, and a deflecting device has a reflecting pyramid (83) rotatable around an axis of rotation. The pyramid scans space of the target with laser radiation boxes to provide 3 dimension (3D) scatter plot of the target space. Surfaces (76-78) of the pyramid enclose two different angles with the axis of rotation.
   USE - Three dimension laser measuring device for use in aircraft e.g. fixed wing aircraft, helicopter and unmanned drone, for measuring large areas. Can also be used in land vehicle e.g. rail vehicle, ship and boat, for measuring waterways and seaside courses.
   ADVANTAGE - The reflecting pyramid of the deflecting device is rotatable around the axis of rotation, where the surfaces of the reflecting pyramid enclose two different angles with the axis of rotation, thus reducing weight, energy consumption and cost of the measuring device, and hence using the measuring device in the aircraft in an efficient manner.

AB    NOVELTY - The system has a controller (600) comprising two grip handles (110a, 110b), and a control area adjacent to the grip handles and including a control part operable to control a portion of a vehicle i.e. unmanned ground vehicle. A function bridge module is removably attached to the grip handles, positioned between the grip handles away from the control area and set within a field of view of the control area. A portion of the bridge module is interchangeable with another function bridge module. A tray portion of the former bridge module is positioned between the grip handles.
   USE - System for controlling a remotely controlled vehicle i.e. unmanned ground vehicle, by a human operator. Can also be used for aerial and underwater vehicles, and drone.
   ADVANTAGE - The system allows an operator to quickly and easily swap modules using different modules to perform different tasks in an efficient manner. The function bridge module is provided within a field of view of control areas of the controller, thus allowing the operator to utilize data faster with high accuracy. The system allows distribution of a center of mass minimizing stress on operator's hands and wrists. The function bridge module keeps a grip to be small and lightweight, reduces vulnerability to vibration and shock, and is easily stowable in a standard military-issue pack or pouch. The system provides unified field of view for allowing a controller operator to view the function bridge without moving his eyes or head, thus reducing operator eye strain.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The function bridge module is selected from a display screen module (405), a pushbutton module (605), and a keyboard module. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a method for controlling a vehicle.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a top perspective view of an unmanned vehicle controller with two alternative interchangeable function bridge modules arranged for slidable interfacing.

GA 2011B41296
AB    NOVELTY - The method involves acquiring geo-localization data (d3) relating to a geographical position of an aircraft (A) during over flight of a geographical area. Timestamp data (d4) relating to date or hour is acquired. A link is created between an image (I) and the geo-localization data according to another timestamp data (d2) and the former timestamp data. The link is inserted in a position corresponding to the geo-localization data in a digital cartographic representation (C) of a geographical area so as to obtain the digital cartographic representation of the geographical area.
   USE - Cartographic method for obtaining a digital cartographic representation of a geographical area of a public sector, a private individual and a company during over flight of the geographical area by an aircraft i.e. helicopter. Can also be used for an airplane, a tethered balloon, an airship, a drone or a satellite.
   ADVANTAGE - The method enables protection of people from environmental defects related to loss of energy due to street lighting, bad heat insulation such as heating, air-conditioning, door frame and renewal of air, of buildings/standard lamp or pollution. The method enables construction of the digital graphical representation that contains images and information relating to the state of a portion of the geographical area corresponding to the image while freeing the representation from administrative authorization requests and avoidance of expensive image processing in terms of cost and time. The method enables simplification of processing of data.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included for the following:

AB    NOVELTY - The method involves receiving threat data and a flight path data. A simulated waypoint along the flight path is computed based on the threat data. The threat data is recomputed based on a location of the simulated waypoint. A determination is made if values of the threat data exceed acceptable values of the threat data. A flight path is indicated to the computed simulated waypoint if the acceptable values of the threat data exceed the values of the threat data. An own-ship position is recalculated.
   USE - Method for managing a flight path of an aircraft subject to a threat. Can also be used for an automobile, tank, personnel carrier, water craft such as boat, ships and submarine and an unmanned craft such as drones.
   ADVANTAGE - The method enables a pilot to recognize presence of threat's vulnerability based on own-ship's detection by a threat-radar along a route even in presence of terrain bounced jamming signals. The method enables amorphous clustering for reducing overhead and providing comprehensive assessment vectors for selected fly-path robustness. The method enables an aircraft to proceed to next waypoint if the threat value is not exceeded the default threat value.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a system for managing a flight path of an aircraft subject to a threat, comprising a processor.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a flowchart illustrating steps of a method for managing a flight path of an aircraft subject to a threat.

AB    NOVELTY - The method involves using a model e.g. changeable model, of an environment e.g. physical environment, and a model of a mechanical device e.g. robot, generating an optimal device state trajectory from a current state through time horizon satisfying constraints. A threat posed to the mechanical device is identified and quantified, and a corresponding threat assessment metric is generated based on a generated optimal trajectory prediction. A threat assessment signal is generated based on the metric and a threat threshold relating to desired stability limits and safety margins of the device.
   USE - Method for generating a signal representing an assessment of threat to a mechanical device e.g. ground vehicle, aerial vehicle, naval vessel, heavy construction equipment, fork lift truck, surgical device (all claimed) such as scalpel, cauterization tool and stitching machine, unmanned underwater vehicle, underground vehicle, agricultural equipment, crane, unmanned aerial drone, unmanned ground robot, remotely-operated passenger vehicle and transport vehicle, operating in a physical or hazard containing environment.
   ADVANTAGE - The threat assessment signal is generated based on the threat assessment metric and the threat threshold relating to desired stability limits and safety margins of the mechanical device, thus accurately assessing threat while providing wide variety of mutually consistent operator assistance modes of varying levels of operator autonomy. The method considers combined effects of vehicle dynamics, stability constraints and terrain interactions, thus evaluating maneuver severity in assessing threat in an efficient manner. The method assesses threat on a realistic corridor rather than an unrealistic single path, thus ensuring safe operation of the device. The method provides accurate threat assessments by considering effects of terrain conditions, environmental disturbances and physical limitations of vehicle actuators. The method enables assessment of threat for more complex vehicle trajectories.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a threat assessment apparatus comprising a processor.

AB    NOVELTY - The aircraft (1) has a support arm structure (3) with a base (30) and three support arms (31a-31c) that radially extend from the base. Three drive units (4a- 4c) are respectively attached to ends of the arms, where each drive unit exhibits rotors (50, 51) and speed-controlled electric motors (60, 61). The motors drive the rotors during an operation of the aircraft. The arm structure is coupled with a hull (2) such that the arm structure is movable relative to the hull for condition and/or position regulation of the aircraft, where the hull is stabilized in a perpendicular position.
   USE - Aircraft i.e. flight drone (claimed).
   ADVANTAGE - The support arm structure is coupled with the hull such that the support arm structure is movable relative to the hull for condition and/or position regulation of the aircraft, where the hull is stabilized in the perpendicular position, so that mass of the hull does not move during tilting of the support arm structure, and energy can be saved in a simple and efficient manner, thus avoiding additional stabilization and/or compensation measures for sensor units and image recording units during implementation of flight maneuver.

AB    NOVELTY - A device for detecting biological agent in air sample, comprises: particle concentration unit that collects particles from air sample into liquid; liquid collection chamber comprising magnetic beads, where magnetic beads are capable of binding polynucleotides; amplification unit for amplifying polynucleotides bound to magnetic beads; and detection system for detecting amplified polynucleotides.
   USE - As device for detecting biological agents in air sample (claimed). The biological agents include pathogens selected from virus, spore, fungus, bacterium and parasite capable of causing disease, injury, or death in humans and/or animals e.g. Bacillus anthracis, Yersinia pestis, Vibrio cholerae, Coxiella burnetii, Francisella tularensis, Clostridium botulinum, Variola major, Lassa virus, Ebola virus and Marburg virus. The device is useful for installation on military equipment e.g. military ground vehicles (e.g. tanks), airplanes, military drones, or missiles.
   ADVANTAGE - The device allows for early, easy, specific and highly sensitive detection of harmful airborne biological agents, such as biological warfare agents. With the device, air samples can be collected and analyzed on site e.g. in outdoor environment, since the device is portable, and is suitable for detection aboard airborn drone. With the device harmful biological agents can be quickly detected without unnecessarily exposing soldiers, laboratory workers or civilians to the agents. The method and device allow for continuous collection and analysis of air samples over long periods of time and thus for ongoing monitoring and surveillance of an area. This permits acquisition of multiple field data, such that confined areas of contamination can be quickly localized and evacuated or avoided if serious pathogens prevent access to such areas. The magnetic beads that comprise oligonucleotide primers on their surface provide an advantage that polynucleotides derived from a biological agent can hybridize to oligonucleotide primers on surface of beads. The performing of multiple instances of detection method with the device when carried out in parallel, improves the analysis rate.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - A device for detecting biological agent in air sample, comprises: particle concentration unit that collects particles from air sample into liquid; liquid collection chamber comprising magnetic beads, where magnetic beads are capable of binding polynucleotides; amplification unit for amplifying polynucleotides bound to magnetic beads; and detection system for detecting amplified polynucleotides. The magnetic beads are positively charged; comprise oligonucleotide primers on their surface capable of specifically hybridizing to target polynucleotides derived from a biological agent; and/or comprise basic functional groups that have been covalently linked to bead surface. The amplification unit is capable of performing real-time PCR, and allows for performing multiple amplification reactions in parallel. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for detecting biological agents in air sample involving: providing air sample; collecting particles from air sample into liquid; releasing polynucleotides from particles into liquid; binding released polynucleotides to magnetic beads capable of binding the polynucleotides; subjecting polynucleotides captured on magnetic beads to polymerase chain reaction; and detecting and/or quantifying amplified polynucleotides.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The figure shows side view of the device for detecting biological agent in air sample.

AB    NOVELTY - The impeller or propeller (1), made from fibers and resins or composites or one or more metals, comprises a set of blades (6) attached to a hub (2). At least one of the blades is oriented with respect to a tilted plane (13) forming a predetermined acute angle (TA) with respect to a vertical plane (14). The tilted plane is rotational clockwise or counterclockwise (CCW) about an axis of rotation perpendicular to the longitudinal axis (3) of the hub in response to medium flow (MF) or fluid flow from either end (4,5) to the other end of the impeller or propeller.
   USE - Impeller or propeller for motor-driven systems. Uses include but are not limited to watercrafts, hydroelectric turbines, air vehicles, compressors, weapon systems, pumps, drones, wind turbines, agitator or mixing systems, and wind turbines (all claimed).
   ADVANTAGE - By orienting at least one of the blades in a tilted plane perpendicular to the impeller or propeller longitudinal axis, the blade can push the medium or fluid in a good direction with more space on the low pressure face area and move the medium or fluid forward instead of sideways for reduced drag, improving workability and efficiency of the entire impeller or propeller. Sections and radial sections of the blade are interpolated to achieve a blade with good structural integrity and smooth blade surfaces.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows the schematic view of a right hand rotation impeller for a motor-driven system.

AB    NOVELTY - The method involves emitting an ultrasound burst at a preset recurrence frequency of drone (D1), and receiving successive signal spikes appearing in course of same frame. Arrival instants of signal spikes of current frame are compared with arrival instants of signal spikes of a previous frame for consecutive frames, and a relative time gap is determined for each spike. A selection criterion is applied to time gaps to retain just a single spike of current frame. Distance is estimated as a function of instant of arrival of the retained spike with respect to an emission instant of another burst.
   USE - Method for estimating a distance of drone by ultrasound telemetry to measure height of drone.
   ADVANTAGE - The method enables filtering of spurious peaks from the burst transmitted by the drone, so as to preserve useful peak corresponding to distance to be estimated from an echo produced by ultrasound burst transmitted by considered drone.

AB    NOVELTY - The method involves comparing positions executed by a target (4) in response to kinematic transition controls with a predetermined setpoint position, and activating a marker when a position equal to the setpoint position is detected. A difference between common kinematic controls is evaluated when the marker is activated. Corrective terms are applied to the kinematic controls before the kinematic controls are supplied to an angular movement simulator (2) and the target if the difference is lower than a predetermined threshold, where the terms are linked to the setpoint position.
   USE - Method for estimating a path of a mobile such as drone and missile, in a real navigation environment after detecting an overrun or a change of a target designated for the mobile during mission.
   ADVANTAGE - The method estimates the path of the mobile in the real navigation environment after detecting the overrun or the change of the target designated for the mobile, thus permitting the evaluation of the target reattacking capacity or target changing and attacking capacity of the mobile according to the targets designated for the mobile during mission.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a hybrid simulation system permitting estimation of a path of a mobile in a real navigation environment.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a block diagram of an estimation system.

AB    NOVELTY - The harpoon (1) has a jack unit including a cylinder unit containing a mobile piston unit. A rod extends beyond the cylinder unit, where a free end of the cylinder unit comprises a harpoon head hooked in an anchoring grate and retaining fingers that are moved between a retracted position and an active position by a control unit. The jack unit is connected to a pressurized fluid source by another control unit having a solenoid valve (31). The pressurized fluid source includes a consumable carbon-di-oxide gas cartridge (30).
   USE - Anchoring harpoon for an anchoring system on a ship to anchor an aircraft i.e. rotary-wing drone type aircraft (all claimed) such as helicopter, on an oil platform.
   ADVANTAGE - The utilization of the jack unit doubles efficiency of the harpoon and decreases the length of the harpoon in a folded position so as to adapt constraints of encumbrance related to the loading on board of a drone. The harpoon utilizes a plating and a return spring outside the jack unit to obtain exact plating force against the grate. The harpoon utilizes a bistable actuator with a rotary mechanical bolt to maintain the harpoon in its position between two impulsion orders for state changing of the harpoon in the grate. The solenoid valve is connected to an adjustable restriction unit to control the gas output during harpooning and purging.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a schematic view of a pressurized fluid supply of a harpoon.

AB    NOVELTY - The harpoon has a jack including a cylinder containing a mobile piston. A harpoon head (7) is hooked in an anchoring grate and comprises retaining fingers (8, 14) that are moved between a retracted position and an active position. A control unit (9) controls movements of the fingers and comprise a control piston (18) that slides inside a rod of the jack. The piston is associated with a bistable actuator i.e. rotary mechanical bolt (19), and moves between the retracted position and the active position in which the fingers are deployed with application of pressure pulses in the jack.
   USE - Anchoring harpoon for an anchoring system on a military ship to anchor an aircraft i.e. rotary wing drone type aircraft (all claimed) such as helicopter, on an oil platform.
   ADVANTAGE - The utilization of the jack doubles the deployment of the harpoon and decreases the length of the harpoon in a folded position so as to adapt constraints of encumbrance related to the loading on board of a drone. The harpoon utilizes a plating and return spring outside the jack so as to obtain a correct plating force against the grate. The utilization of the bistable actuator maintains the harpoon in its position between two impulsion orders for state changing of the harpoon in the grate.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows an exploded prospective view of a hooking harpoon head for entering a harpoon.

AB    NOVELTY - The harpoon has a cylinder unit (4) comprising a mobile piston unit (5) provided with a rod (6) extending beyond the cylinder unit. A free end of the cylinder unit has a harpoon head (7) hooked in an anchoring grate (2) and comprises retaining fingers (8) that can be moved between retracted and active positions. The cylinder unit comprises telescopic cylinder portions (10, 11) moving between a position in which one portion is retracted inside the other portion, and an active position, where one portion projects outside from the other portion in the active position.
   USE - Anchoring harpoon for an anchoring system used for anchoring an aircraft i.e. rotary wing drone (all claimed), on a military ship platform. Can also be used for anchoring an aircraft on an oil platform.
   ADVANTAGE - The telescopic jack doubles a deployment course of the harpoon for a same folded length and decreases the length of the harpoon in folded position, thus adapting to the constraints of encumbrance related to loading on board of a drone.

AB    NOVELTY - Invention relates to control over aerodynamic surfaces and can be incorporated with the circuit of controlling cyclic pitch of multi-blade rotor, primarily, of drone small-size helicopter. Stabilisation system consists of gyro fitted on rotor shaft with the help of yoke 1 and spider. Said gyro comprises ring 9 with gimbal, three rods 11 and three weights 12. Ring 9 is coupled with jacks 15 of rotor blade dogs 16. Blades are mounted with the help of yokes 17. Weights 12 feature aerodynamic shape and are arranged on the ends of rods 11 with fixed installation angle. Gyro coupled with rotor shaft by gimbal precesses with speed of said shaft. Weights 12 can be arranged and fixed at different distances of rotor rotation axis, thus, varying gyro ability of counteracting deviation of rotor blade end surface from gyro plane.
   USE - Aircraft engineering.
   ADVANTAGE - Reduced weight of proposed system, better attenuation of gyro vibration, simple design of gyro ring suspension.

AB    NOVELTY - The method involves extending a field of view by a multi-resolution mosaic (10) produced from images and by inserting contextual datum in a repository of common images of a scene, where number of resolution levels of the mosaic is estimated from the characteristics of the video. The field of view is enhanced by a piece of information referenced in contextual data (16). The auxiliary localization data are inserted in the current image of the scene.
   USE - Method for virtually extending and enhancing a field of view of common image in a scene created by a video during videomonitoring of a zone such as ground or flying engine e.g. drone, aircraft, helicopter or dirigible balloon, or during relay of sports such as annual bicycle race, Formula I or riding sports.
   ADVANTAGE - The method facilitates interpretation of the current image by its inclusion in the global context and its semantic enhancement. The method avoids recalculation of the complete mosaic at each image, thus limiting unuseful calculation load, and preventing rapid degradation of the image quality.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a schematic representation of extension of the field of view of the scene by combined utilization of a multi-resolution mosaic and contextual data.'(Drawing includes non-English language text)'

AB    NOVELTY - The head (1) has a transversal branch (3) comprising a front face comprising an antenna radar. One of the side branches comprises detectors (4, 5) i.e. navigation or detection radars. A rear face is provided with optronic sensors (6) e.g. laser rangefinder. An upper face comprises a shape for being in continuity of a peak of a solid mass of an underground vehicle i.e. underwater drone, when a mast is in retracted position. The transversal branch is aligned with a longitudinal axis of the underwater vehicle when the mast is in retracted position.
   USE - T-shaped multifunctional telescopic mast head for an underwater vehicle i.e. underwater drone (claimed).
   ADVANTAGE - The transversal branch is aligned with the longitudinal axis of the underwater machine, thus reducing cost and mass. The head combines the radar antenna and the optronic sensor, thus avoiding the masts from multiplying while offering better qualities of detection in the entire field of navigation. The shapes of the hand increase the performance of the radar detector, thus ensuring better continuity of the top of the solid mass without use of a shutter or any other specific device.

AE RYABUKHA N N (RYAB-Individual)
GA 2010M26178
AB    NOVELTY - Invention relates to aircraft engineering, namely to method of landing drone aircraft on arresting gear. Proposed method consists in that, in landing, aircraft flight trajectory is formed so that engagement with cable engage section occurs in pass or after pass above said section. Then air propulsor is cut in to brake aircraft to preset speed as fast as possible and engage cable release is adjusted. Note here that, for preset landing approach speeds in operation of particular aircraft type, engage cable system characteristics are defined so that width of engage band swept by flexible driving element is not less than flight trajectory height control accuracy for given type of aircraft. After engagement with arresting gear 1st stage engage cable, intensive absorption of aircraft kinetic energy is performed by acting with concentrated force on the main load bearing element of airframe. Then at arresting gear 2nd stage coupled with the 1st one, drone aircraft is braked to complete stop by concentrated force on the surface of damping elements of 2nd stage.
   USE - Transport.
   ADVANTAGE - Higher operating performances of drone aircraft.

AB    NOVELTY - The engine has two rotary cup fuel injectors (53) injecting two types of fuels e.g. cold and viscous fuels, into a primary burn zone (82) and a secondary burn zone (84) to produce a primary combustion swirl and secondary combustion swirl, respectively. The injectors inject the fuels from outer or inner walls of a combustor (80), where a distance between the inner and outer walls of the combustor is short so that the fuels and air are impinged against an opposite wall to produce one of the primary or secondary combustion swirls in a combustion chamber.
   USE - Gas turbine engine for use in an unmanned air vehicle (UAV) i.e. small cruise missile. Can also be used for the gas turbine engine in a drone.
   ADVANTAGE - The combustor requires few parts, igniter, fuel injection tubes, simple and plain holes, and a small number of sheet metal components, thus providing reliable, producible and low cost system. The engine allows an engine fuel pump to be smaller, low in cost and precise with respect to fuel metering. The engine minimizes installation volume requirements while providing adequate engine throttle ability without flame-out. The combustor achieves enhanced stability and/or lower emissions using two burn zones. The engine enables rotary cup fuel injection for fine fuel atomization for easy ignition and efficient and clean burning. The engine utilizes a rotary cup for fuel injection into primary and secondary burn regions and zones in order to maximize combustor operating range and efficiency. The engine achieves reliable ignition and rapid acceleration without the need for expensive and heavy start assist systems and ignition systems. The engine achieves improved low speed efficiency for faster, reliable, starting, and lower cruise- speed fuel burn. The engine is small, compact and expendable. The engine is manufactured at low cost with improved performance and operating service life in order to increase the range of operation.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a cross sectional view of a gas turbine engine with a rotary cup fuel injector delivering fuel into primary and the secondary burn zones.

TI Folding and locking mechanism for wing assembly of e.g. tube launched missile, has plunger that is urged into mating contact with aperture of wing bracket when shaft subassembly and wing subassembly are in extended position.
AU WHITHAM K G
AE US SEC OF NAVY (USNA-C)
GA 2010G38498
AB    NOVELTY - The mechanism has a shaft subassembly and a wing subassembly that are configured in an extended position by rotation about a bolt (150) such that a wing (102) experiences simultaneous rotation about x and y axis of an external store's frame. A spring urged locking plunger (80) is arranged in a plunger cavity (76) formed on a knuckle of a cylindrical shaft (30) of the shaft subassembly. A semi-cylindrical aperture (142) is formed in a sidewall of a wing bracket. The plunger is urged into contact with the aperture when the shaft subassembly and the wing subassembly are in the extended position.
   USE - Folding and locking mechanism for a wing assembly of a vehicle e.g. smaller unmanned aircraft such as a tube launched missile, a shoulder launched missile and a surveillance drone.
   ADVANTAGE - The mechanism enables providing folded and extended wing positions with reduced number of components, thus increasing reliability, simplifying manufacturing process, and reducing manufacturing cost of the vehicle. The plunger cavity is in coaxial alignment with the aperture in the bracket side wall, thus permitting a tapered end of the plunger to fully engage the aperture, and hence positively locking the wing in a fully extended position. The knuckle curvilinear upper surface is in touching contact with the inner surface of a bracket curvilinear wall in the fully retracted or folded position of the wing, thus stopping rotation between the shaft subassembly and the wing subassembly, and hence reducing the angle between the longitudinal axes of the shaft and the wing, and hence providing a compact, foldable articulated wing assembly.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows an exploded side perspective view of a folding wing mechanism.

AB    NOVELTY - The assembly has a central main body wing (22) comprising outboard edges (26) and two external wings joined to the main wing at the outboard edges. The main wing has geometric parameters corresponding to 33 degrees angle of sweep at zero degree of a chord, dihedral angle of zero degree, twist angle of zero degree and trailing edged defined by specific polynomial equation. The main wing has a pair of elevons (32) on the outboard trailing edge. A nacelle receives a motor, where the nacelle is formed in a forward portion of the main wing along a flight axis of the main wing.
   USE - Wing assembly for an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) or drone e.g. blended wing body small UAV and blended wing body micro UAV. Can also be used for a hobbyist aircraft i.e. radio controlled aircraft.
   ADVANTAGE - The design configuration of the assembly includes wing twist on the outboard wing and an inverted W shaped platform to provide lateral and longitudinal stability, and smooth, even flight characteristics throughout the range of the expected flight envelope. The flight characteristics are crucial to provide a stable reconnaissance platform with favorable stall speeds, an increased payload and the ability to hand launch without the danger of exposing hands or wrist to a propeller.

AB    NOVELTY - The method involves forming a set of connecting paths between successive way points (1-5), and producing a tree comprising edges and nodes connected by the edges, where each edge corresponds to each connecting path. Each node is arranged corresponding to each way point, and a route is determined based on selection of edges of the tree. The tree is provided with a set of tree levels on which the nodes are distributed. Nodes of tree levels are assigned to different values of a characteristic of way points.
   USE - Method for determining a route of a vehicle i.e. aircraft (claimed) such as airplane, helicopter, drone and rocket, in a military, along two way points predetermined successively with given connecting paths. Can also be used for an unmanned aerial vehicle, automobile, rail-mounted vehicle, ship or submarine.
   ADVANTAGE - The tree can be produced on the basis of the connecting paths at reduced cost. The method enables computational determination of the connecting paths before starting the route determination and/or outside of the vehicle, in a time-intensive manner and using higher computing power, and hence achieving the way points in a given time interval and with minimum costs.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included for the following:
   (1) an on-board computer comprising a device for determining a route of a vehicle
   (2) a data carrier comprising connecting paths formed between way points.

AB    NOVELTY - The process involves determining a raster set (1602a) comprising topographical raster points between a starting point and an end point, and determining costs associated with respective raster points of the raster set. Nodes for each raster point of a subset of the raster set is determined, where the nodes are associated with approach directions of an aircraft e.g. air vehicle (1604), to the raster point. A cost-minimized flight route between the starting point and the end point is determined by a shortest path algorithm by taking most cost-effective nodes into account for a particular point.
   USE - Process for determining a cost-minimized flight route for an aircraft e.g. manned air vehicle and unmanned air vehicle such as drone, cruise missile and rocket, between a starting point and an end point using an air control system, an onboard computer and a flight control system (all claimed).
   ADVANTAGE - The process permits directing most cost-effective nodes to the raster point, and additional nodes are no longer pursued in the shortest path algorithm, so that the runtime of the shortest path algorithm is reduced to obtain the acceleration factor from the ratio of nodes to the most cost-effective nodes, thus determining the cost-optimal flight route between the starting point and the end point for the aircraft while reducing the runtime in an effective manner.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a system for determining a cost-minimized flight route for an aircraft between a starting point and an end point.

AB    NOVELTY - The system has an image processing unit i.e. processor (19), associated to a shooting unit that shoots an environment near a landing zone, for determining position of a drone with respect to a naval platform from the configuration of optical markers forming units perceived by the shooting units. The shooting unit is formed of a large field camera (16) and small field cameras (17, 18). The optical markers forming units are formed of LEDs i.e. infra-red LEDs. A control unit controls blinking of the LEDs.
   USE - System for determining position of a drone in approach phase, on a naval platform.
   ADVANTAGE - The configuration of the large field camera and the small field cameras optimizes acquisition of the drone during rapprochement of the drone, thus improving the precision of the determination of the drone position, and increasing ambiguity. The control unit controls the blinking of the LEDs, so as to improve a signal-to-noise ratio. The LEDs improve the processing of images.

AB    NOVELTY - The system (100) has a platform (115) i.e. airborne vehicle, defining a chamber (109), and a faceted window (118) that closes the chamber. A gimbaled laser detection and ranging (LADAR) sensor (103) is housed in the closed chamber to scan a LADAR signal through the faceted window. The sensor is capable of scanning the LADAR signal in azimuth around one hundred and eighty degree. A laser designator is mounted on-gimbal with the LADAR sensor. A large mode area fiber is utilized for transmitting the beam generated by the LADAR laser to the LADAR sensor.
   USE - Wide-angle laser detection and ranging system for use in military-, civilian remote sensing, and missile operations to detect and identify targets in night and foggy weather. Uses include but are not limited to tanks, vehicles and guns and laser radar transceiver missiles.
   ADVANTAGE - The sensor is housed in the closed chamber to scan laser detection and ranging (LADAR) signal in azimuth around one hundred and eighty degree, thus providing lookdown and loitering capabilities in the wide-angle LADAR system. The LADAR system is mounted in front of an aerial platform and used over azimuth angles exceeding 90 degrees, thus allowing the LADAR system to track and accurately designate targets continuously, while the missile moves above a circular loitering pattern.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The airborne vehicle is provided as a flying submunition, a guided weapon system, a reconnaissance drone, or a manned aircraft. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a method for scanning a laser detection and ranging signal.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a side perspective view of a laser detection and ranging system in an assembled view.

AB    NOVELTY - The system has an electronic control unit including an information processing unit i.e. processor, that provides a synthetic image (100) of terrain (110) to a display screen e.g. cathode ray tube screen. The image comprises a physical final destination representation of a wind cone (112) provided with an elliptical lower part, a vertical junction line i.e. strut, and a perspective representation. Shape and orientation of the lower part represent a local slope of the terrain at the place of the wind cone.
   USE - Synthetic vision system i.e. graphic display system, for displaying information concerning piloting or navigation, to a pilot of an aircraft e.g. rotary wing aircraft such as helicopter, or fixed wing aircraft. Can also be used for a drone or an unmanned air vehicle.
   ADVANTAGE - The system displays the information concerning piloting or navigation, to the pilot of the aircraft in an efficient, ergonomics and intuitive manner. The configuration of the system permits a pilot to manage the aircraft by acquiring the knowledge of a direction to be traced, and efficiently visualizes the environment by correlating the visualization from the system and an exterior environment, thus reducing the operation load of a processor and reducing the stress of the pilot. The physical representation provides information such as direction, wind speed and terrain inclination, to the pilot, thus preserving a tail plane and an anti-torque rotor of the aircraft. The configuration of the system permits improving of readability of images by reducing the number of displayed symbols.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a method for displaying a final destination for a synthetic vision system mounted on an aircraft.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a schematic front view representing a final destination display comprising a wind cone.

AB    NOVELTY - The system has an electronic computer with a processor to provide synthetic images (100) of a terrain (110) comprising a symbol (114) representing radio-navigation beacons e.g. Very High Frequency Omni directional Range beacons, on the terrain, to a display screen e.g. LCD screen. The beacons located beyond a first distance from the system are not represented. The beacons provided at a distance ranging between the distance and second distance from a carrier, are represented in symbolic form. The beacons provided at a distance less than the second distance are represented in physical form.
   USE - Synthetic vision system i.e. graphical display system, for presenting piloting or navigation information to a pilot of a fixed or rotary wing type aircraft such as drone or unmanned air vehicle. Can also be used in a terrestrial vehicle or ship.
   ADVANTAGE - The processor permits the display of the radio navigation beacons provided at the distance less than the distance from the carrier in physical form, and prevents the display of the beacons provided at a distance greater than the distance so as to limit operation load of the processor and improve readability of the image by reducing the number of displayed symbols and declutter operations. The system presents the piloting or navigation information to a pilot of an aircraft in an ergonomic manner.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a method for displaying radio navigation beacons for a synthetic vision system mounted on a carrier.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a schematic view representing a display of radio navigation beacons situated at a distance from a carrier in different configurations, in a form of symbols.

AB    NOVELTY - The separation device has a pointed separation edge (6) perpendicular to a flow, where the separation device is directly arranged at a root of a support surface i.e. wing, of a missile. A tip is pointed towards a flight direction and formed by two surfaces that are guided to an upper side (2) and a lower side (3) of the missile and run in a downstream direction. The separation device is bordered by a fuselage surface and a surface lying perpendicular to the support surface at a gap exceeding fuselage limit layer thickness. The edge forms an angle of 90 degree in a wind direction (5).
   USE - Device for separation of a turbulent limit layer of a fuselage at a wing root from a front edge of a support surface i.e. wing, of aircraft, rocket, flight control body, drone and space shuttles (all claimed) in aircraft construction, military missile construction, rocket construction, civil aircraft construction, and space shuttle construction. Can also be used for wind turbine construction.
   ADVANTAGE - The separation device separates the turbulent limit layer from the front edge of the support surface of the aircraft to prevent contamination of the fuselage limiting layer on the support surface of the missile, thus reducing the friction losses of the fuselage limiting layer, and reducing fuel consumption, exhaust emissions and noise emission of the aircraft, and increasing the cruising range of the aircraft.

AB    NOVELTY - The method involves estimating a latency time between the transmission of a command to a mobile station and the execution of the command by the mobile station. An image acquired by a camera at an instant is transmitted to the remote station. Position of a target object on the image is transmitted to the mobile station and compared with a position of the object on another image. A trajectory of the object on the latter image is determined autonomously and in real time. On-board camera is controlled in real time so as to track the object on the predicted trajectory.
   USE - Method for controlling an on-board camera in a mobile station i.e. drone, so as to track a target object such as vehicle, individual and building or fixed or movable aircraft, on predicted trajectory, from a remote station (all claimed) i.e. drone control ground station.
   ADVANTAGE - The method controls on-board camera in real time so as to track the object on the predicted trajectory. The method determines the position of the target object on the image based on the predicted position and predicted speed vector, without additional control of the movement of the camera from the remote station. The method permits the camera to modify its field of vision in order to include a predicted position of the target object without using an additional control.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included for the following:
   (1) a device for controlling an on-board camera in a mobile station from a remote station, comprising a latency delay estimation unit
   (2) a computer program stored on a recording medium and comprising instructions for controlling an on-board camera in a mobile station from a remote station.

AB    NOVELTY - The recorder (40) has an electronic interface arranged within an enclosure (42). A crash survivable memory unit is arranged within the enclosure and electrically coupled to the interface for storing data e.g. audio data. A recorder independent power supply (46) i.e. battery pack module, is arranged within a notch (43) of the enclosure. The power supply has an electrical connector coupled to the enclosure for providing an operating voltage to the interface and the memory unit, where physical dimensions of the supply and the connector are placed within a form factor of the enclosure.
   USE - Flight recorder i.e. data recorder, for use in an aircraft (both claimed) e.g. commercial aircraft. Can also be used for fixed wing and rotor aircraft such as military aircraft, drone, ultra-light aircraft, blimp, balloon and flying wing, and marine transportation system such as boat, submarine, hovercraft, pleasure/recreational, scientific, commercial and land-based vehicles, and space travel.
   ADVANTAGE - The recorder's independent power supply has the electrical connector coupled to the enclosure for providing operating voltage to the electronic interface and memory unit, where physical dimensions of the supply and connector are placed within the form factor of the enclosure, thus enabling an integration of the power supply within the flight recorder without a need for a special connector, a wiring and a separate space beyond dimensional specifications of the recorder.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included for the following:
   (1) an aircraft comprising an airframe
   (2) a method for making a data recorder.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a perspective view of a flight recorder with a recorder independent power supply physically residing within a form factor of an enclosure.

AB    NOVELTY - A turbine assembly (20b) comprises turbine; gas supplying unit for supplying gas at higher than ambient pressure to one end of turbine; and gas exhausting unit for exhausting gas from turbine, located at the end of turbine opposite to one end. The gas exhausting unit (210) is in communication with a region at or below ambient pressure. The gas at higher than ambient pressure is provided by predetermined deflagration of anaerobic fuel.
   USE - A turbine assembly for use in power generation plant useful in providing electrical energy to electrical motor or manufactured article that requires external source of electrical energy; providing propulsion to airplane, drone craft, space-going craft, motor vehicle including automobile, van, pickup truck, sport-utility vehicle, bus and truck, tank or other armored vehicle, agricultural vehicle including thresher, reaper, combine harvester and tractor, boat and/or ship, hovercraft, above ground- or underground operated locomotive, motorcycle, motorized bicycle, motorized tricycle and/or motorized cart; and powering microturbine, nanoturbine used to drive nanoscale machine and/or device that requires rotating shaft, and pump (claimed).
   ADVANTAGE - The turbine assembly runs at low temperature, without the necessity of oxidant, without producing pollutants including nitrogen oxides and sulfur oxides; and can be adapted to any size or power required by user. Since the turbine assembly is adapted to utilize anaerobic fuel without any need for external oxidant, it can easily be adapted to operating environments with low free oxygen, i.e. at high altitudes or underground (particularly during rescue operations following mine fires). Properly sealed, the turbine assembly can even operate in oxygen-free environments including outer space or under water. The turbine assembly need not be constructed from scratch. Any existing turbine assembly can be adapted for use with anaerobic fuel. Since the impulse provided by deflagration of anaerobic fuel will be much higher than that provided by combustion of standard fuels, part of adaptation will necessarily be a calculation of how many rotor blades and/or rows of blades will be necessary to achieve the same output as turbine had prior to adaptation, and the number will be smaller than that in existing turbine assembly.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are included for:
   (1) method of using anaerobic fuel to drive the turbine;
   (2) generation of energy utilizing deflagration of anaerobic fuel; and
   (3) method of adapting existing turbine assembly for use with anaerobic fuel.
   The turbine is multistage turbine.

AB    NOVELTY - The method involves associating measurements corresponding to an object e.g. boat or aircraft, respectively at the level sensors (1a-1d) by utilizing the measurements taken by the sensors, to form mono-sensor tracks in a decentralized association phase. Values characterizing the mono-sensor tracks are estimated by using the measurements provided by the sensors, to form multi-sensor tracks in a centralized estimation phase. The sensors respectively position centers of associations zones of the mono-sensor tracks to positions estimated from the multi-sensor tracks.
   USE - Method for fusing measurements taken by sensors e.g. radar, electro-optical sensor, infrared sensor, electronic support measure sensor, identification friend or foe transponder, automatic identification system receiver and automatic dependent surveillance broadcast receiver, that are utilized for measuring reflected electromagnetic waves, heat emission, intensities of visible light and electromagnetic waves emitted by radars, for listening responses to interrogation and very high frequency emission of a boat and an aircraft, and for being carried by an aircraft (all claimed) e.g. airplane and drone, during monitoring an environment e.g. aerial volume or a water surface area, on which an object e.g. boat such as patrol boat, and aircraft, is found, or during establishing an aerial situation around the aircraft.
   ADVANTAGE - The method enables sending back the multi-sensor tracks towards the sensors to reposition the association zones, thus improving the quality of association and estimation of the mono-sensor tracks with reduced risk of association error, reducing quantities of data for centralized estimation of the values characterizing the mono-sensor tracks without affecting estimation precision, and ensuring dynamic calibration of the sensors.

AB    NOVELTY - The accelerometer (34) has an acceleration transducer that generates uncorrected analog acceleration signals representing vertical, lateral and longitudinal components of acceleration of an aircraft. An error correction unit has an analog-digital converter (120) that converts uncorrected analog acceleration signals received from acceleration transducer into uncorrected digital acceleration signals. A compensation circuit compensates uncorrected digital acceleration signals using correction coefficients received from a system controller.
   USE - Accelerometer e.g. three-axis accelerometer for general aviation and commercial aircraft. Uses include but are not limited to helicopter, propeller driven aircraft, experimental aircraft, drones, ultra-light aircraft, blimp, balloon, military aircraft, flying wing, boat, submarine, hovercraft used in scientific, commercial and military application.
   ADVANTAGE - Uncorrected digital acceleration signals can be compensated effectively using correction coefficients received from system controller. Hence, the corrected digital acceleration signals can be produced reliably and information representing vertical, lateral and longitudinal components of acceleration of aircraft can be analyzed effectively. The manufacturing cost of accelerometer can be reduced and reliability of accelerometer can be improved.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are included for the following:
   (1) accelerometer-based system; and
   (2) method of compensating errors in accelerometer.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a block diagram of the accelerometer.

AB    NOVELTY - Invention relates to system designed to increase survivability of drone planes (DP). Proposed method comprises generating signals sent in false directions with the help of opening traps arranged on shoot-off cartridges with pyro charge and accommodated on DP fuselage, and stochastic variation of aircraft course. If DP is locked after it overcomes 1/3 to 1/2 of flight to target, enemy radar system operation is dropped out by stochastic change of DP course and simultaneous change of DP radar reflection by shooting off opening traps. Note here that trap shoot-off is made on the side opposite to DP course change. Note also that shoot-off traps re-reflect enemy radar signals to enemy fire control center in enemy frequencies and with the enemy polarisation mode. DP course is directed towards target, on final part of DP trajectory, with shoot-off of traps.
   USE - Weapons.
   ADVANTAGE - Higher probability of overcoming enemy anti-aircraft system.

TI Radiation detection and materials identification method for mobile vehicle e.g. car, in e.g. roadway, involves judging whether radiation source is hazardous material when material with spectral images is identified as hazardous material.
AU FRANK D L
AE INNOVATIVE AMERICAN TECHNOLOGY INC (INNO-Non-standard)
GA 2009N89663
AB    NOVELTY - The method involves receiving radiation data associated with a radiation source from radiation sensors (114, 116) e.g. gamma ray sensor, mechanically coupled to a mobile vehicle e.g. car. A histogram is generated based on the received data. The histogram is compared to spectral images associated with known materials, and the histogram substantially matched with the spectral images of the materials is identified. A judgment is made whether the source is a hazardous material when the material with the spectral image is identified as hazardous material.
   USE - Method for detecting radiation and identifying materials associated with radiation by an information processing system on a mobile vehicle (all claimed). Uses include but are not limited to a ground vehicle e.g. car and truck in a roadway, water vehicle i.e. boat, in a harbor and waterway channel, air vehicle e.g. helicopter and drone, in airport, amphibious vehicle and a plane with water landing pontoons.
   ADVANTAGE - The sensors detect radiation data that is compared to spectral images for each isotope to be identified by a spectral analyzer, thus enhancing the reliability and efficiency of matching spectral image data from the sensors to the spectral image data. The sensor array configurations of the mobile vehicle can yield greater scan times to examine spectral analysis and hazardous material identification corresponding to an object in a fast and effective manner.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The histogram represents a spectral image of the radiation from the source. The hazardous material is a chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear and explosive (CBRNE) material. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a system for detecting radiation and identifying materials associated with radiation in a motor vehicle.

AB    NOVELTY - The method involves receiving a controlling order corresponding to an orientation control of a steerable nose wheel of an aircraft and a current ground speed of the aircraft. Orders for brake and engine assemblies (E1, E2) of an aircraft are determined from the controlling order and current ground speed, in a manner to generate a lateral movement on the aircraft, when the determined orders are applied to assemblies, where the lateral movement is identical to another lateral movement that generates an application of the controlling order to the wheel.
   USE - Method for lateral piloting aircraft traveling on ground i.e. airport. Uses included bur are not limited to a cargo aircraft, civil aircraft, military aircraft, passenger-carrying aeroplane, goods carrying aeroplane, and drone.
   ADVANTAGE - The method can ensure a minimum directional control to pilot to rapidly free a landing strip, when the orientation system of wheel of the aircraft does not function correctly. The method ensures that the pilot can control the aircraft in safe manner in normal case, during landing phase, thus reducing the workload and stress of the pilot.

GA 2009N47771
AB    NOVELTY - The turbine has an outer cylindrical or ring shaped body with coils or magnet (3) placed along the length of the body or housing (4), where a stator is integral to the housing or body. An inner integrated and bladed armature component spins along a central axis so that the magnet or coil component of an armature past the stator is propelled when flow is directed through turbine blades (5). A combined turbine unit in which force of various kinds passing through the center of the turbine cause the blades to turn to propel the armature past the stator to produce electricity.
   USE - Integrated electrical generating turbine. Uses include but are not limited to industry application, electrically driven train, consumer scale hybrid automobile, and camping or remote military area.
   ADVANTAGE - The turbine eliminates the need for a separate generating device, thus making the turbine more compact and eliminating efficiency loss due to mechanical linkages or shafts. The turbine can be constructed to any scale ranging from an industrial size generation turbine down to a miniaturized self contained power source for the smallest applications using air/gas, liquid or heat flow to drive the turbine. The turbine avoids aviation assets such as drones. The turbine can be simply placed into a moving body of water with minimal if any structural build out to support the turbine in a camping or remote military area, and generate electricity on an industrial scale.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a schematic view of an inner armature assembly, showing turbine drive blades, framework housing the blades, and case magnets as the outer edge of an armature.

AB    NOVELTY - The system has a controller coupled to a fly-by-wire (FBW) aircraft, and generating real-time pilot control data from an aircraft maneuver command. The real-time pilot control data is generated in accordance with a predetermined control law. A FBW flight control system (FBW-FCS) interface system is coupled to the controller, and converts the real-time pilot control data into real-time simulated FBW-FCS pilot control signals. The real-time simulated FBW-FCS pilot control signals direct the FBW-FCS such that the FBW aircraft performs in accordance with the aircraft maneuver command.
   USE - System e.g. flight control system such as fly-by-wire flight control system, and unmanned airborne vehicle (UAV) control system, for converting a man-rated fly-by-wire (FBW) aircraft into a remote controlled UAV that is utilized as target drone by providing military pilots with realistic, high performance targets during airborne training, for aerial surveillance, weapons delivery, and target training. Uses include but are not limited to converted F-16 fighter aircraft, F-18, F-4 Phantom fighter aircraft, flying wing aircraft and delta-wing aircraft such as B-2, F-106, B-58, F-117, F-22, Airbus A380, F-22, and Boeing 777.
   ADVANTAGE - The system converts the man-rated fly-by-wire (FBW) aircraft into the remote controlled unmanned airborne vehicle (UAV) or a target drone in an inexpensive manner. The system provides the legacy fly-by-wire (FBW) system with brake commands to control the speed, deceleration and ability to stop the aircraft under remote or autonomous control. The system implements the conversion by modifying a flight control processor logic to merge external sensor signals and commands into control surface commands that drive the unmanned airborne vehicle (UAV), so that the aircraft is reused for airborne missions that do not require a pilot or on-board crew after a man-rated aircraft is retired, and is modified to take advantage of the existing systems by replacing the functionality typically provided by a pilot, and so the system is changed in order to allow control by a ground controller.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a method for converting a man-rated fly-by-wire aircraft into a remote controlled unmanned airborne vehicle.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a block diagram of an airborne control system.

AB    NOVELTY - The assembly has a centrifugal compressor wheel provided with a curved tooth coupling. A turbine wheel is provided with another curved tooth coupling interconnected with the former curved tooth coupling by meshing a set of longitudinally concave teeth with a set of longitudinally convex teeth. A shaft extends from the centrifugal compressor wheel. A tie bolt is extended between the shaft and the turbine wheel to compress the curved tooth couplings. The centrifugal compressor wheel, the turbine wheel, the shaft, and the tie bolt are assembled to span a distance less than fourteen inches.
   USE - Rotor assembly for a miniature gas turbine propulsion system i.e. miniature gas turbine engine, of a small vehicle e.g. reconnaissance drone, and air-launched and ground-launched cruise missiles. Can also be used for a weapon system or weapon decoy.
   ADVANTAGE - The convex and concave teeth of the curved tooth couplings are machined into respective flanges, thus reducing manufacturing cost of the shaft couplings to minimum level, and hence reducing total costs associated with the engine used in expendable missions. The enhanced robustness and accuracy of the curved tooth couplings increases reliability of the engine in mission-critical operations. The assembly utilizes the tooth couplings, which increases the reliability of the engine such that vehicle can be used in exigent circumstances where reliability is critical.

AB    NOVELTY - The target regions in an image are identified and old tracks and new tracks are assigned to the identified target regions. The fully occluded tracks are identified and track discard rules are modified to maintain the occluded tracks for a greater duration of unassigned target regions. A motion model used to predict tracks identified as fully occluded is adjusted to maintain the occluded tracks along a last observed path and to gradually increase a prediction uncertainty. The tracks to be maintained and the tracks to be discarded are decided using the modified rule and model.
   USE - Method of visually tracking targets with occlusions. Uses include but are not limited to vehicles driving through urban environment, pedestrians in airport, plaza or mall and ships traveling near city or port, and in unmanned vehicle e.g. airborne surveillance drone, satellite, manned vehicle e.g. car, tank, aircraft, spacecraft, submarine and robot, in video camera mounted on endoscope.
   ADVANTAGE - Enables tracking targets with both partial and full occlusions effectively. Reduces the number of clutter or false alarm tracks and maintains efficiency of tracking algorithm.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are included for the following:
   (1) system for visually tracking targets with occlusions; and
   (2) computer readable medium storing program for visually tracking targets.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows the flowchart of the method for visually tracking targets.

AB    NOVELTY - The method involves monitoring an area using omni-directional sensor devices (2a-2x) of one type e.g. panorama sensors, which are sensitive in an optical frequency range e.g. radio-wave and/or microwave frequency range. The area is monitored using omni-directional sensor devices (4a-4x) of another type e.g. direction-finding sensors, which are sensitive in a frequency range different from the former optical frequency range. Determination is made whether signals received from the sensor devices correlate or not with respect to place of origin.
   USE - Method for detecting an intrusion vehicle e.g. small aircraft such as drone (all claimed), in a military area and a civilian area to protect an object such as building, camp and airport, from being inspected by unauthorized persons. Can also be used for detecting a ground vehicle, water craft such as submarine and ship, helicopter, vertical take-off and landing plane and blimp, to protect an object such as sea lab.
   ADVANTAGE - The area is monitored using omni-directional sensor devices of another type, which are sensitive in a frequency range, and the determination is made whether the signals received from the sensor devices correlate or not with respect to place of origin, thus reducing false alarm rate, and hence facilitating reliable and accurate detection of intrusion vehicles.

AB    NOVELTY - The system (15) has a determining unit (8) for automatically determining a speed profile according to maximum speed and constraints e.g. time constrains, relative to the moving of an aircraft on an airport area e.g. aerodrome. The profile provides the variation of the longitudinal speed according to the time that elapses during the moving of the aircraft along a path. A transmitting unit (11) transmits the profile to aircraft piloting assisting units (12, 13). The aircraft piloting assisting units assist the piloting of the aircraft using the profile received from the unit (11).
   USE - System for assisting the piloting of an aircraft e.g. passenger or goods i.e. cargo, transport aeroplane, and long-haul aircraft. Can also be used for a military or civil aeroplane, and a drone.
   ADVANTAGE - The system assists choosing of the compromise between the minimum occupancy time of runways and tracks, and the minimum utilization of brakes and engines. The system effectively predicts the occupancy time of the tracks and paths before landing the aircraft so as to permit the air/ground control to forecast circulation problems at the ground and to adapt the forward planning of the airport. The system permits air companies to improve the prediction of the usage of actuators e.g. engines, and the usage of the brakes, to provide benefits of maintenance operations. The system optimizes run time between two points in the airport area, thus reducing time of occupancy of the tracks and the paths. The system optimizes the utilization of the actuators, thus reducing the wear of the brakes, and the fuel consumption of the engines with respect to the manual piloting. The system controls the airport traffic, and improves the comfortness of passengers of the aircraft. The system provides optimal speed profile to the pilot when the speed of the aircraft is manually controlled. The system effectively predicts the energy stored in the brakes of the aircraft. The system generates the speed profile that is adapted to the trajectory at the given ground, such that the profile corresponds to constraints such as longitudinal jerk and load factor constraints, related to the form of the trajectory. The system quantifies the longitudinal and lateral accelerations for transport failure of the aircraft, thus eliminating the transport failure.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The speed profile is provided at each of a set of elements of the airport area. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a method for assisting the piloting of an aircraft.

AB    NOVELTY - The method involves measuring current position, current course, current lateral speed and current longitudinal speed of an aircraft. Current curvature with path current target point and current lateral deviation are determined from a taxiing path and the measured current position. Speed of a yaw representing speed command of the yaw is calculated from the measured current lateral and longitudinal speeds and the current curvature, the current lateral deviation and current angular deviation to allow the aircraft to move along the path.
   USE - Method for generating speed command of a yaw for an aircraft e.g. passenger transport airplane such as A380 and A340-600 type passenger transport airplane, and cargo airplane, rolling at the ground along a path of an aerodrome or airport for automatic lateral guiding of the aircraft (claimed). Can also be used for a civil airplane, a military airplane or drone.
   ADVANTAGE - The method enables the guiding system to precisely monitor the exterior environment such as movement of other vehicles and environment obstacles, and communication with aerial/ground control of the aircraft, thus reducing the workload of a pilot during displacement phase of the aircraft, and permitting the pilot to concentrate on other tasks such as speed of the aircraft. The method ensures the positioning of the aircraft with respect to an axis of the running track or airport domain elements through which the trajectory passes, thus ensuring guiding of the aircraft, whose relative length opposite to the dimensions of traffic lanes can be difficult such as the risk of leaving out of the wheels from coating without requiring additional device such as external camera to assist the pilot and authorizing the movement of the aircraft under visual conditions without utilizing the external assistance.

AB    NOVELTY - The method involves receiving a path and a speed profile. A current position of an aircraft is measured. Interpolated speed is calculated from the path, profile, and current position, where the speed represents a speed value of the profile corresponding to the current position of a control point of the aircraft. A weighting factor is determined, and auxiliary speed is determined from the factor. The auxiliary speed is multiplied by the factor to obtain a control speed representative of a longitudinal speed order for allowing the aircraft to move on the ground, while following the profile.
   USE - Method for generating control speed for an aircraft such as passenger transport airplane or cargo plane, moving on the ground along a path of an aerodrome or airport for automatic longitudinal guiding of the aircraft (claimed). Can also be used for a civil airplane, military airplane or drone.
   ADVANTAGE - The method limits excessive speed of the aircraft in order to maintain the aircraft in limits compatible with airport regulation, passenger comfort, skin and tire states, and loads on a landing gear of the aircraft. The method enables the guiding system to precisely monitor the speed profile of the aircraft, thus reducing workload of a pilot during displacement phase, and permitting the pilot to concentrate on other tasks such as lateral guiding of the aircraft. The method ensures optimal utilization of actuators of the aircraft, with less number of activations of brakes or motors.

AB    NOVELTY - The method involves receiving information relative to a path to be followed and automatically determining a running path e.g. take-off track, at the ground based on the information, by a determination unit (3). Current values of parameters of an aircraft are automatically measured, and a yaw speed set point is automatically determined based on the current values and the running path so as to permit the aircraft to follow the running path at the ground. The yaw speed set point is utilized by a piloting assisting system (10) for assisting piloting of the aircraft.
   USE - Method for partially and automatically driving an aircraft running on a ground in an airport or aerodrome. Uses include but are not limited to airplane, civil or military aircraft, passenger transport aircraft, goods transport aircraft and drone.
   ADVANTAGE - The method permits the partial automatic driving of the aircraft during a ground run on airport field to reduce workload of a pilot during a running phase by considering guidance of the aircraft, thus permitting the pilot to concentrate on tasks such as monitoring exterior environment and communications with air or ground control. The method ensures position of aircraft with respect to axles of tracks and circulation path and facilitates the circulation of aircraft in visibility conditions to guide the difficult aircraft, without using external assistance such as vehicle. The method generates guiding orders to improve comfortness of passengers and crew during turns, accelerations and braking and optimizes run time between two points in aircraft field, thus reducing time of occupancy of the tracks and paths. The method permits to predict the occupancy time of the tracks and paths before landing the aircraft so as to permit the air/ground control to forecast circulation problems at the ground. The method ensures passage of aircraft at passage points and at given schedule to permit the control to optimize the planning of traffic at the ground. The method permits air companies to improve prediction of usage of actuators e.g. engines, to provide benefits of maintenance operations.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a partial automatic device for driving an aircraft running on the ground in an airport field, comprising a navigation system.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a schematic block diagram of a device for driving an aircraft running at ground.

AB    NOVELTY - A cantilever beam (306) is connected to base portion (304). An actuator cell (302) adjacent to cantilever beam comprises metal electrodes (308,310) positioned on cantilever beam. A phase change material (312) between the metal electrodes is heated by applying burst of energy so as to change between amorphous state and crystalline state while moving cantilevered beam. The cantilevered beam remains at a target position (B), when energy supply is stopped.
   USE - Phase change actuator for micro electro mechanical system (MEMS) switch, switch for selecting antenna in mobile phone, data storage applications of rewritable compact disk (CD), DVD, solid state memory device, and actuation applications for positioning optical waveguide in optical switch, activating control functions in drone vehicle such as radio controlled vehicle, or in locking mechanism.
   ADVANTAGE - Since the cantilevered beam can be maintained at target position even after stopping energy supply, power consumption can be improved.

AB    NOVELTY - The method involves calculating attitude of a mobile unit based on signals from a gyroscopic measurement unit (1) and an accelerometric measurement unit (2), position and speed of the mobile unit at an instant, and signals provided by a magnetic measurement unit (3) representing projection of terrestrial magnetic field in a three-dimensional magnetic mark. The position and the speed of the mobile unit are calculated at another instant based on the attitude, signals from the units (1, 2) at the latter instant, the position and the speed at the former instant, and signals from the unit (3).
   USE - Method for determining attitude, position and speed of a mobile unit such as flying vehicle i.e. projectile, with respect to ground for navigating the mobile unit. Can also be used for determining attitude, position and speed of other flying vehicles such as missile and drone, or a non-flying vehicle.
   ADVANTAGE - The method corrects drifts of the gyroscopic and accelerometric measurement units by readjusting on a fixed reference which is the direction of terrestrial magnetic field, thus precisely determining the attitude and the position of the mobile unit, in real time, by using the low cost measurement units.

A receiver unit (26) i.e. antenna, receives the signal and is integrated to a target designator (3). The unit (26) is associated to a control unit i.e. interrupter (25), which controls starting-up of the designator. The unit (21) has a light source (13) oriented to illuminate the operation ground. The unit (26) has a detector that detects radiation emitted by the source.
   USE - Device for remotely controlling a target i.e. tank, designator arranged on an operation ground, from an attack module e.g. ammunition such as projectile, sub-projectile, missile or attack drone (all claimed) e.g. small remote controlled aircraft such as mini remote controlled airplane and mini remote controlled helicopter, which acts over a target and is dispersed by a delivery vehicle i.e. projectile cargo.
   ADVANTAGE - The configuration of the device ensures low transmission range of the signal, thus easily reducing effective firing time of the designator based on configuration of the ground, so as to reduce detectability of the designator. The remote control signal is transmitted in the form of light pulse to reduce energy consumed by the attack module.

AB    NOVELTY - The method involves deploying a remotely operated vehicle from a vessel, where the remotely operated vehicle carries sensor devices (30) in a storage compartment. Each of the sensor devices is placed in selected locations in a marine environment, and a transfer skid is deployed from the vessel including other sensor devices provided on a platform (130) integral to the transfer skid. Each of the latter sensor devices is transferred from a transfer device (100) e.g. drone, to the storage compartment by actuating the platform in one of linear and circular directions.
   USE - Method for installing a sensor array e.g. discrete or cabled subsurface sensor array such as seismic sensor array or seismic recorder array e.g. ocean bottom seismometer array and seafloor seismic recorder array, in a marine environment.
   ADVANTAGE - The method allows the remotely operated vehicle to be operated autonomously or semi-autonomously in the marine environment. The method allows mechanical stresses related to lifting and lowering of the remotely operated vehicle to be minimized, thus minimizing deployment and retrieval time of the sensor devices in a seismic operation.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included for the following:
   (1) a method for retrieving sensor devices from a subsurface location
   (2) a transfer skid for storing seismic devices.

AB    NOVELTY - The aircraft has a fuselage equipped with wings (2). Missile-firing tubes (3) are fixed at extrados of the wings by forming an inclination angle (A) with the wings such that the missile-firing tubes are inclined towards the bottom. The inclination angle is higher than 5 degrees and lower than 11 degrees with respect to a fuselage horizontal reference. A front edge (5) of each tube is in projection with respect to a leading edge (6) of each wing on a determined distance (d) such that the front edge of each tube is extended above a perturbation zone generated by the wing.
   USE - Aircraft i.e. tactical drone. Can also be used for a strategic drone and common fighter airplane.
   ADVANTAGE - The missile-firing tubes are fixed at extrados of wings by forming inclination angle with the wing such that tubes are inclined towards the bottom, thus permitting direct aiming of a target, increasing the firing range, and permitting landing of the aircraft even when the aircraft is placed with less clearance at the ground. The inclination angle is higher than 5 degrees and lower than 11 degrees with respect to the fuselage horizontal reference, thus minimizing aerodynamic moment applied on a missile during firing, and hence permitting ejection of the missile without an instability risk. The configuration of the aircraft reattaches the air stream with the wing, thus avoiding the degradation of the global load-bearing capacity. The configuration of the aircraft protects the missile from a potential impact with the ground. The position of the tubes facilitates the manipulation of the aircraft during preparation at the ground. The inclination of the tubes degrades high warm at the rear of the tubes, thus protecting an airfoil and an aileron of the aircraft from the ejection of a propulsive unit during departure of the aircraft.

GA 2009F09920
AB    NOVELTY - The automatic compensating control method involves sensing the speed of air relative to an aircraft (12) at a predetermined distance in front of the aircraft. The speed of the air is determined so as to determine whether the predetermined distance is indicative of an environmental condition. An automatically compensating control of the aircraft is performed by the time the aircraft enters an environmental condition such as turbulence, wind shear.
   USE - Automatic compensating control method of aircraft (claimed) e.g. drone for environmental condition e.g. turbulence, wind shear.
   ADVANTAGE - Prevents the air vehicle from overshooting above the trajectory since compensating for the detected turbulence is performed. Reduces the circle of error probability since the measurement of accuracy with which an air vehicle, such as a rocket or missile, can be guided. Increases operational accuracy of the air vehicle by proactively compensating for turbulence when correcting trajectory of an air vehicle.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included for the following:
   (1) an automatic compensating control system;
   (2) and an aircraft.

TI Electromagnetic pulse delivery system for use in motorized vehicle e.g. automobile, has capacitive discharge system, which is capable of producing electromagnetic pulse, coupled with compressible mechanical interface.
AU DAILY R M
AE US SEC OF NAVY (USNA-C)
GA 2009B31282
AB    NOVELTY - An electromagnetic pulse delivery system (10) has a capacitive discharge system (28) connected with a compressible mechanical interface (16). The discharge system produces an electromagnetic pulse of sufficient energy and waveform for inducing a current in target electronic components, disrupting or damaging the components, and overwhelming any protective circuitry associated with the components. The interface delivers the pulse to the target object, containing the components, by physical contact, and includes a movable front wall (40), a rear wall (42), and coil springs (24).
   USE - Electromagnetic pulse delivery system for generating and applying electromagnetic pulses necessary for disabling target electronic components e.g. computer control network, in target object e.g. suspect vehicle. Can also be used in a mobile delivery platform such as motorized vehicle e.g. automobile, police vehicle, tactical vehicle, motorcycle, airplane, helicopter, ship, boat, submarine, unmanned underwater vehicle, drone, remote control vehicle, all-terrain vehicle, tractor, truck, bus, construction equipment, as well as a stationary delivery platform e.g. a stationary contact strip.
   ADVANTAGE - The delivery system is easy and inexpensive to construct, install, and deploy, and can be easily retrofitted to any existing type of mobile deployment system e.g. police vehicle, and stationary deployment system e.g. stationary contact strip, since the system does not use complex and costly transmitters and lasers to transmit electromagnetic pulses or require reliance on cutting edge technologies that may not be fully mature, and eliminates need for receiver or other circuitry to be mounted on the target vehicle.

AB    NOVELTY - The system (30) has conducting holes (33, 34-1-34-3) formed in a dielectric material layer i.e. support matrix (32), where the holes form a metamaterial. The hole (33) forms a part of a central monopole of a folded monopole. The holes (34-1-34-3) are arranged around the hole (33), where each hole (34-1-34-3) has an end that is electrically connected to a ground plane (31) and forms a part of parasitic wires of the folded monopole. A conducting rim (35) is formed on a surface of the dielectric layer and electrically connects another end of the hole (34-1-34-3) with an end of the hole (33).
   USE - Parasitic monopole antenna system i.e. tactical air navigation antenna system, for being embarked in a platform (claimed) e.g. aircraft such as tanker aircraft, and drone. Can also be used for a train.
   ADVANTAGE - The dielectric material layer permits simple and inexpensive manufacturing of the antenna system. The system is light in weight and can be operated at a microwave frequency ranging from 300 mega Hertz to 300 giga Hertz. The configuration of the system permits reduction of relative displacement of the central monopole with respect to the parasitic wires so as to reduce fluctuation effect of coupling between the central monopole and the wires, and avoid impedance modification of the system, while improving efficiency of the system. The configuration of the system permits the folded monopole to be easily immersed in artificial material such as metamaterial or photonic band gap material. The utilization of parasitic wires permits increase of high bandwidth of the folded monopole of the system and ensures better rotational symmetry of a radiation pattern of the system, while improving performance of the system. The configuration of the system permits realization of two dimensional antenna system i.e. planar antenna system, or three dimensional antenna system e.g. surface antenna system and multiplane antenna system, efficiently.

AB    NOVELTY - The method involves identifying a body e.g. vehicle, and determining that a projection of the body axis intersects an exclusion zone if the body follows an original desired attitude trajectory. Attitude commands are modified to steer the projection of the body axis around the exclusion zone, where the attitude commands are modified in such a way that associated rates and accelerations are within dynamic limits of the body. The attitude commands are modified to minimize the amount of time for which an original desired attitude trajectory of the body is modified.
   USE - Method for guiding a body i.e. celestial body such as vehicle e.g. spacecraft, for performing a function relative to an attitude trajectory, in an aerospace system, telecommunication system, intelligent transportation system and global positioning system, in space, air, water and on land to track objects e.g. missiles, for military and civilian application. Can also be used for submarine, aircraft and drone.
   ADVANTAGE - The method uses only measurements and sensing of present situation at any given time, without propagation, to perform an exclusion zone avoidance maneuver. The method modifies target-tracking attitude commands such that a resulting attitude command profile avoids pointing the boresight into the exclusion zone, and minimizes duration of compromised tracking, thus preventing the actual boresight from pointing into the exclusion zone.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a flow diagram illustrating a method for generating attitude commands to perform an exclusion zone avoidance maneuver.

TI Sensor e.g. accelerometer, calibrating method for e.g. drone, involves summing and integrating values to obtain total result, dividing result by known value to obtain estimation of bias, and calibrating sensor using bias.
AE ETAB PARROT SA PIERRE (PARR-Non-standard)
GA 2009B03554
AB    NOVELTY - The method involves determining two times (Ta, Tb), where a function value (V) and a real value (Y) of measured quantity are identical. Values (Zi) of sensors are connected from the time (Ta) to the time (Tb), and the values (Zi) are summed and integrated to obtain a total result (S). The result is divided by a known value to obtain an estimation of a bias (b), and a sensor e.g. accelerometer, is calibrated using the bias.
   USE - Method for calibrating a sensor e.g. rate gyro, and accelerometer (claimed), embarked on a toy e.g. aircraft, drone and quadricopter, for measuring a physical unit.
   ADVANTAGE - The method requires components already present on an inertial unit, and does not require temperature sensor, stellar navigation information, global positioning system navigator, geographical, radiometric or terrain information, so that the sensor can be calibrated in a simple and inexpensive manner.

The apparatus launches a canister-launchable vehicle (103) e.g. rocket.
   USE - Apparatus for use in a vehicle system (claimed) e.g. ground-based vehicle system or mobile vehicle system, for launching a canister-launchable vehicle e.g. airborne or water-borne vehicle such as rocket or missile, from a canister. Can also be used for a powered munition, a drone or a torpedo.
   ADVANTAGE - The apparatus minimizes compromise of the structural integrity of the vehicle, avoids production of visible and/or thermal signatures, minimizes obscuring of sensor windows of the vehicle. The apparatus minimizes enemy forces determining the location of a vehicle launch site, minimizes damage to propulsion and/or control systems of the vehicle, and efficiently launches the vehicle.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a stylized, partial, cross-sectional view of a portion of a vehicle system illustrating the operation of an apparatus for launching a vehicle.

   USE - Hybrid helicopter for transporting passengers. Can also be used for a reduced weight drone.
   ADVANTAGE - The helicopter does not have an anti-torque rotor so as to simplify mechanical assemblies in the helicopter, thus reducing weight and cost of the helicopter while ensuring improved endurance, safety, comfort, service life, performance, flexibility and adaptability of the helicopter. The design of the helicopter avoids degradation of aerodynamic performance of the rotor, and controls longitudinal cyclic pitch of the rotor during coasting flight, for maintaining an attitude of the fuselage at a pitch angle that is equal to a slope of a trajectory, for avoiding an incidence angle of the fuselage with respect to air, thus reducing parasite drag of the fuselage. The design of the helicopter efficiently carries out missions during extended vertical flying time, and ensures a coasting flight at high speed for permitting the helicopter to travel for a long flying range.

AB    NOVELTY - The helicopter (1) has a cell including an airfoil surface (3) fixed to a fuselage (2), and an integrated kinematic chain including a mechanical interconnection system interconnecting a thermopropelled rotor (10) and pusher propellers (6) with a control of collective pitches of propeller blades. Turboshaft engines (5) drive the system, where output rotation speeds of the engines, the propellers, the rotor and the system are proportional to one another. A speed proportionality ratio is constant irrespective of flying configuration of the helicopter in normal operating conditions of the chain.
   USE - Hybrid helicopter for transporting passengers. Can also be used for a reduced weight drone.
   ADVANTAGE - The helicopter does not have an anti-torque rotor so as to simplify mechanical assemblies in the helicopter, thus reducing weight and cost of the helicopter while ensuring improved endurance, safety, comfort, service life, performance, flexibility and adaptability of the helicopter. The design of the helicopter avoids degradation of aerodynamic performance of the rotor, and controls longitudinal cyclic pitch of the rotor during coasting flight, for maintaining an attitude of the fuselage at a pitch angle that is equal to a slope of a trajectory, for avoiding an incidence angle of the fuselage with respect to air, thus reducing parasite drag of the fuselage. The design of the helicopter efficiently carries out missions during extended vertical flying time, and ensures a coasting flight at high speed for permitting the helicopter to travel for a long flying range.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a perspective view of a hybrid helicopter.

AB    NOVELTY - The system has an audio power amplifier (108) e.g. switching amplifier, and a transducer (106) electrically connected to the audio power amplifier. An enclosure (102) is coupled to the transducer, and a secondary resonant element is coupled to the enclosure. An electrical feedback signal representative of the transducer current is negatively fed back to the audio power amplifier to synthesize positive output impedance. The synthesized positive output impedance is positive over an entire operation of the transducer.
   USE - Audio system i.e. analog system, for amplifying an audio signal and supplying the signal to a loudspeaker i.e. speaker module.
   ADVANTAGE - The electrical feedback signal representative of the transducer current is negatively fed back to the audio power amplifier to synthesize the positive output impedance, so that the synthesized positive impedance can be increased to avoid overdriving condition of the drone at secondary resonant frequency for reducing the frequency of the secondary resonant element. The output impedance can be reduced using negative current feedback, so that the frequency response of the sound pressure output of the loudspeaker system can be flattened around the secondary resonance and the displacement of the drone can be reduced, thus improving reliability of the audio system. The current-controlled synthesized output impedance allows drone damping control without utilizing a power dissipating element.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a method of reproducing sound.

AB    NOVELTY - Collision avoidance method involves sensing images from a target object; generating polarized images from the sensed images; calculating one or more composite images from two or more of the polarized images by performing an algebraic manipulation between two or more polarized images; and tracking the target object based on composite images.
   USE - Method for avoiding collision between vehicle and target object. Uses include but are not limited to unmanned vehicle such as unmanned spacecraft (AS) and/or unmanned aircraft system (UAS), unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), remote-piloted vehicle (RPV), unmanned air combat vehicle (UCAV), remotely operated aircraft (ROA), drone, rocket, and/or missile, manned vehicle such as private airplane and/or jet, commercial airplane and/or jet, water vessels that includes at least one of boat and/or ship, road vehicle, rail vehicle, and/or space-going vehicle.
   ADVANTAGE - Obtains improved target object detection by using polarized image with advantage that background or scattered light has different polarization characteristics when compared to man-made aircraft or other man-made target objects. Reduces image processing required to automatically detect and track the target object such as aircraft in the image since background and/or scatter are essentially subtracted or otherwise algebraically manipulated from the image using polarization differencing so that targets objects such as man-made aircraft or other man-made objects tend to be polarized in specific plane and are less likely subject to the differencing calculations thus in processed image the background tends to go to constant color or shade of gray and aircraft stands out against the background, therefore improves the performance of sensing elements while reducing the size, weight, and power required by the processing components.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are included for the following:
   (1) a system for avoiding collision between a vehicle and a target object; and
   (2) a machine-readable medium that provides instructions causing a computer to perform operations of a method for avoiding collision between a vehicle and a target object when executed by the computing platform.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a block diagram of a detect, sense and avoid system for an unmanned vehicle.

AB    NOVELTY - The radar (3) has a cylindrical shaped structure (4) providing a degree of freedom in rotation with respect to an aircraft along a circular axis (23). Another cylindrical or spherical shaped structure (5) provides another degree of freedom in rotation with respect to the former structure along elevation axis (26) converged with the former axis. An aerial (28) receives and transmits electromagnetic waves. An electronic mainboard and electronic daughtercards assures the processing of the waves transmitted or received by the aerial. The aerial and the module are fixed on the structure (5).
   USE - Air-borne radar for tactical drone that is utilized at the end of cartography of a territory, in territory monitoring mission and in theatre of war.
   ADVANTAGE - The radar is robust and compact. The structure of the radar reduces the production and maintenance cost of the radar and minimizes the masses of the radar, while liberating fans and inertial masses employed in the radar. The radar has optimized volume for facilitating the transport and the handling of the drone equipped with the radar. The radar allows loading a larger quantity of fuel to gain in flight endurance. The structure of the radar provides good aerodynamics, thus allowing the drone to limit over consumption related to the presence of the radar, and hence increasing the flight endurance of the drone. The structure of the radar protects breakable surfaces such as window radome, and exposes reinforcement surfaces such as cowl. The radar allows the components to be easily accessible and dismountable by removing the radome and the cowl, thus replacing the defective part without demounting the assembly of the radar.

AB    NOVELTY - The method involves carrying unmanned reconnaissance drones (14, 16) in combat helicopters (10, 12), and launching the reconnaissance drones into an operational area from the flying combat helicopters. Reconnaissance data are transmitted to the helicopters from the drones. The drones are launched by a weapon system/launcher of the combat helicopters, and are assisted by a booster, attached to the drones, in a starting phase of the drones. The drones are destroyed after completion of a reconnaissance mission.
   USE - Method for enlarging a reconnaissance radius of a combat helicopter (claimed).
   ADVANTAGE - The unmanned reconnaissance drones are carried in the combat helicopters, and the drones are launched into the operational area from the flying combat helicopters, thus enlarging the reconnaissance radius of the combat helicopter without the need for a special start platform and without continuing requirements such as speed, at the drones.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a schematic representation of utilization of a reconnaissance drones.

AB    NOVELTY - The structure has a fiche fixedly provided on a hit side of a rod body, and a group of wave-shaped concave-convex odontogram for generating friction, when hitting the border of clay target placed on a hit surface of the fiche. The odontogram is matched with lines on the border of the clay target, and a fixed chip is placed on an opposite side of the hit surface of the fiche. Multi through-holes are formed on the fixed chip, and fixed holes are formed on the rod body. A bolt fixing structure is provided between the through-holes and the fixed holes.
   USE - Trip-rod structure for a target drone.
   ADVANTAGE - The structure adopts the fiche on the rod body side, when the concave-convex odontogram hits the clay target to generate stronger friction force, thus improving stability of the clay target flying.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a perspective view of a target drone's trip-rod structure.

AB    NOVELTY - The wing has a coupling unit with male and female coupling parts (5, 6) carried by wing elements parallel to wing longitudinal length, respectively. The parts have upper and lower surfaces ends (7, 8, 10, 11) mutually inclined to be connected and to be separated with each other in direction of free ends (5b, 6b) of the parts, respectively, where the ends (7, 10) are plane. A retaining unit (19) retains the parts in a coupled position with the surfaces constantly maintained in mutual support, so that the parts are blocked with respect to each other against relative rotation in the position.
   USE - Lift wing for an aircraft e.g. glider or drone.
   ADVANTAGE - The configuration of the retaining unit authorizes simple and rapid assembly and disassembling of whole or part of the wing of the aircraft while preserving the characteristic of mechanical resistance and behavior to the coupling of the wing during the flight of the aircraft. The wing easily facilitates the assembly of the parts and avoids the damage of the parts. The wing is implemented in a cost effective manner.

AB    NOVELTY - The method involves determining two magnitudes related to the display of an environment (2) using a determining unit, where one of the magnitudes is located on one side of a fixed point (5) and another magnitude is located on another side of the fixed point. A deviation between the two magnitudes is determined in an environment-observation optical field of a passive type sensor (3) such as video camera type optical camera. An aircraft (1) is automatically guided in the environment in a guiding direction, where the guiding direction depends on the deviation.
   USE - Method for guiding an aircraft (claimed) e.g. drone, in an environment e.g. smooth or low relief type environment or urban environment.
   ADVANTAGE - The utilization of the passive type sensor avoids the need for a knowing the priori knowledge of the environment, and avoids the need for knowing the cartography of the environment, thus guiding the aircraft in the environment in a simple, robust and cost effective manner, and providing capacity of guiding to the aircraft, flying in low altitude and in the vicinity of obstacles, in an autonomous manner. The sensor is easily located in a progression axis of the aircraft. The method provides a good estimation of the presentation of the obstacle.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a schematic representation of a top view of an evasive action of an obstacle.

TI Confirmation method for automatic command or speech recognition (ASR) using activation means, involves monitoring user-issued command signals and comparing them with commands in command set in ASR during time-out period.
AU DESROCHERS D
AE ADACEL INC (ADAC-Non-standard)
   ADACEL INC (ADAC-Non-standard)
GA 2008G81155
AB    NOVELTY - The method involves identifying in the ASR a signal from an activation means for activating ASR that precedes user-issued command signal. Upon identifying the signal from activation means, a timer is started to define predetermined time-out period and user-perceptible signal is issued to show that ASR is awaiting receipt of user-issued command signal. A command to be compared with user-issued command signal is then retrieved from storage medium associated with ASR. User-issued command signals in ASR are monitored during time-out period and compared with commands in command set.
   USE - Confirmation method for automatic command or speech recognition using activation means. Uses include but not limited to vehicles, aircrafts, drone, marine operations, lunar excursion modules, planetary excursion modules, and their combinations.
   ADVANTAGE - Provides an ASR-user interface that gives the user a way to confirm a recognition result with very high reliability. Uses an activation means, such as a pushbutton, that starts and stops the ASR processing, but in a different manner from prior approaches to confirm the result. Provides better accuracy and reliability than known prior art solutions due to the use of explicit controls as activation means to initiate command recognition. Provides a confirmation system that is more robust in an operational environment where ambient noise is out of control.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - When one of the user-issued command signals matches one command in the command set during the timeout period, the recognition command signal is sent from the ASR to the user and waiting for the confirmed recognized command signal from the user is performed before sending one ASR command signal to the controlled system. When none of the user-issued command signals match any command in the command set during the time-out period, the ASR is reset at the end of the time-out period to await receipt and identification by the ASR of a subsequent user-issued command signal. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for the command confirmation system.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing is a process flow diagram illustrating the confirmation system for speech recognition results using an activation means.

AB    NOVELTY - The apparatus i.e. cage (10), has a chassis (14) defining a housing allowing entry of an underwater/marine vehicle (1) via an entrance. A receiving unit (18) receives a nose of the vehicle and has sufficient freedom of movement relative to the chassis to accompany the movement of the vehicle, when the unit lies near the entrance. Superimposed guides (58, 60) guide the unit along the housing, and orient the unit and the vehicle by restricting the freedom of movement of the unit and the vehicle relative to the chassis as the vehicle gradually enters the housing.
   USE - Apparatus for recovering or launching an underwater or marine vehicle i.e. autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) e.g. torpedo, from a recovering base e.g. boat, quay or offshore platform. Can also be used for recovering a non-autonomous vehicle and a surface drone.
   ADVANTAGE - The guiding and orientation of the vehicle facilitate its entry at the interior of the housing and avoid impacts between fragile parts e.g. wings, of the vehicle and the chassis. The receiving unit has sufficient freedom of movement, so that it can be oriented to ensure better reception of the vehicle, while avoiding the appearance of mechanical constraints in the vehicle when the nose of the vehicle is retained in the unit as the vehicle enters the housing, thus facilitating the recovery of the vehicle in choppy sea. The recovering apparatus eliminates the need for the vehicle to move in an autonomous manner, thus ensuring the recovery of an autonomous vehicle, rotting autonomous vehicle and non-autonomous vehicle.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for an installation for recovering an underwater or marine vehicle from a recovering base.

AB    NOVELTY - The method involves selecting a component of a system under test (SUT) (202) for debugging the SUT. An area of a system memory is mapped out as peripheral component interface (PCI) space for storing debug data for a component that is selected for debugging in the SUT. A copy of the debug data is stored in the PCI space that is mapped out in the system memory in the SUT. A DRONE card (206) is coupled to a PCI bus (204) in the SUT, where the DRONE card reads the debug data to and writes debug data from the PCI space.
   USE - Method for debugging a system under test (SUT) in a data processing system e.g. computer such as personal computer, network computer and mainframe computer. Can also be used for a server, workstation, router, switch, personal digital assistants (PDA), telephone, and other system capable of processing, transmitting, receiving, capturing and/or storing.
   ADVANTAGE - The method retrieves the system status and debug information from the SUT with minimal disturbance to the normal software flow and hardware operation using a low- cost, and highly configurable debug environment from a single piece of lab equipment e.g. DRONE card.

AB    NOVELTY - A catalyst (c1) comprises several porous clusters (c2) of silver particles, each cluster of the clusters including several primary particles (a1) of silver, and crystalline particles (b1) of zirconium oxide, where at least a portion of the crystalline particles of zirconium oxide is located in pores formed by a surface of the primary particles.
   USE - In an air electrode useful as cathode in an electrochemical cell such as alkaline fuel cells, metal hydride anode alkaline fuel cells, metal-air rechargeable batteries, metal-air non-rechargeable batteries, oxygen sensors, and electrolysis cells (such as chlor-alkali cells (e.g. air/oxygen depolarized chlor-alkali cell)) (claimed); useful in air cathodes of electrochemical cells which are useful as power sources for back-up power, portable and emergency uses, electric vehicles, biomedical devices like hearing aids and cochlear implants, portable telecommunication devices for military and civilian use, portable electronic devices, pilot-less drones, and in the space program.
   ADVANTAGE - The B.E.T. specific surface area of the silver-based catalyst is 3-16 (preferably 6-10) square meters per gram; an average agglomerate B.E.T. porosity of the catalyst is 30-50 (preferably 35-45)%; and a tap density of the catalyst is 1-3 (preferably 1.5-2.5) g/cc. The electrodes made with the silver catalyst and silver catalyst mix have advantages over prior art silver-catalyzed electrodes including longer life time, more robust structure and much higher stability porous structure permitting maintenance of the surface area under both the open circuit voltage (OCV) and closed circuit conditions, and also much improved capability to operate in the bi-functional mode in alkaline electrolytes. The air cathode may allow electrochemical cells, such as batteries and fuel cells, to last longer and significantly cuts their costs. The silver catalyst allows the production of carbon-less air cathodes thus making the cathode much more robust for extended life, easier manufacturing, and better durability. The catalyst also provides much higher power than non-precious metal catalysts like those based on manganese, cobalt, and nickel, at much lower cost than platinum. The carbon-less silver based catalyst electrode can be used as a direct drop-in replacement for conventional air cathodes in alkaline fuel cells and metal-air batteries to reduce cost and improve performance. One of the factors limiting the commercialization of rechargeable metal-air batteries is the presence of carbon in the cathode, which tends to oxidize and degrade during charging. Thus, the carbon-less cathode also enables development of rechargeable metal-air cells that are not otherwise viable.

AB    NOVELTY - The controller has a user interface (12) to communicate with and to receive instructions from an operator, where the controller provides autonomous control to a vehicle for a period of time. The instructions have task instructions and path planning information. An environmental sensor array receives sensor data e.g. vehicle speed, about the vehicle or the vehicle`s surrounding environment. The array communicates the sensor data to a vehicle interface. A processing unit has software for communicating with the interfaces and the array.
   USE - Autonomous vehicle controller for providing autonomous control and path planning to a vehicle e.g. forklift, tractor, golf ball collection vehicle, farm or lawn mower equipment, mobile camera security vehicle and warehouse vehicle, transportation vehicle such as automobile, boat, submarine, airplane and helicopter, that is utilized for transporting a passenger, and non-transportation vehicle such as truck, construction vehicle, warehouse vehicle, cargo hauling vehicle and unmanned motorized vehicle e.g. sentry robot and aerial drone, drive-by-wire or tele-operated vehicle, non-drive-by-wire vehicle, and vehicle for exploration, scouting, reconnaissance, and mapping.
   ADVANTAGE - The controller is easy to install in existing vehicles, and provides autonomous control that permits interoperability to the vehicle. The controller eliminates the need for large numbers of environmental sensors and large amounts of computing power to synthesize data generated by the array.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a schematic diagram of an autonomous vehicle controller in a working environment.

AB    NOVELTY - The structure has a main structure constituted by a hollow body which contains sea water in a flexible reservoir (S) and large quantity of pressurized gas that is used for three distinct functions. Proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) modules or equivalent electric power generators are inserted in sections of the structure and are supplied by gaseous fuel. An autonomous system for technical buoy and surface transmission is recuperated from depth. A releasable and reusable autonomous anchoring system makes a submarine drone of large autonomy made in all sizes and shapes for all functions.
   USE - Autonomous dynamic submarine structure for extracting, recuperating, capturing and storing submarine wealth, drilling/coring operations, facilitating intervention on wreck, for surface and deep pumping operation, processing and delivering operations, for deployment of self recoverable and complex deep installation and for electrical energy production in industrial field, for geological and sub marine tectonic analysis, for scientific study of flora, fauna, stream and climate, for submarine archeology, for selective recuperation and for sub-ice cellar exploration in scientific field, for dormant or patrolling coast guard application, dormant or patrolling military recognition and detection and for detection and recuperation of mine and other offensive engines in military fields.
   ADVANTAGE - The structure permits to produce autonomous units for energy, mobility, communication and submarine intervention, while avoiding the need for battery for energy supply. The structure offers resistance to the materials used, resistance to external and internal pressures, and resistance to the volumes. The structure does not utilize fuel storage installation, has increased autonomy and loading and intervention capacity.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The functions are supply of oxygen and hydrogen from electric current generator modules based on proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC), positive and negative compensation of overall weight for the assembly of the structure and for acquired or casted off loads by replacing embedded sea water volumes, and supply of gas for embedded equipments operating with compressed air.

AB    NOVELTY - The apparatus has a clutch selectively coupling movements of a higher-bandwidth electromechanical actuator to a pilot control. A vehicle controller receives command information from a portable computer e.g. portable computer, in an aircraft e.g. airplane, and a remote operator. The controller operates the clutch and the actuator to manipulate the pilot control. A vehicle sensor unit provides information (144) e.g. vehicle pitch, to a pilot interface unit and the controller. An external communication unit receives command information from a remote vehicle commander.
   USE - Used in a multi-mode unmanned and manned vehicle system e.g. weapons and surveillance system, for converting a manned aircraft such as helicopter e.g. MDHI MD53OF helicopter, airplane, airship, truck, boat, hovercraft, and spacecraft, to an unmanned aerial vehicle e.g. unmanned flight (claimed), and pilot-less or drone aircraft, that is utilized for reconnaissance and engagement of an enemy force in a mission application.
   ADVANTAGE - The configuration of the apparatus reduces the unmanned aerial vehicle e.g. pilot-less or drone aircraft, development and deployment costs while providing enhanced multi-mode unmanned and manned vehicle capabilities, and effectively ensures logistics and maintenance of the unmanned aerial vehicle.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a method of piloting an aircraft.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a representation of a vehicle system.

AB    NOVELTY - The method involves extracting an elevation measurement from an amplitude of an interference signal (41) by using an electromagnetic detection system, where the signal is produced by a signal transmitted directly from a target e.g. drone, and another signal transmitted by the target in ground direction and reflected by the ground to a radar. A detection signal is emitted by the system towards the target. The interference signal received at an antenna (21) is sampled at the level of sub-networks (22) and the measurement is established from the amplitude of the signal.
   USE - Used for determining elevation of a target such as passive reflector and aircraft e.g. drone, that is closer to the ground and flies at a very low altitude, by an electromagnetic detection system, in order to guide the drone in the final landing phase (all claimed).
   ADVANTAGE - The method allows to improve precision of elevation localization with less number of measurements, while maintaining a constant antenna dimension. The method can be adapted to existing radar models and can be implemented on different types of antennae. The method utilizes a simple processing to be implemented to reduce implementation costs and requires reduced calculation units to limit the number of reception channels. The method can be utilized on a complete network antenna and on a lacunar antenna in a simple manner.

AB    NOVELTY - The navachitravina is a beautiful 20 stringed, fretless musical instrument played with a slide, like Chitravina, Vichitravina and Hawaiian guitar. The external structure of the Navachitravina consists of a flat resonator and a main playing board. The distance from the main bridge to the secondary one is 27 inches long and 2.75 inches wide. This instrument then tapers off at the portion where the tuning keys are placed. The resonator is 16 inches at its widest point. The total length of the Navachitravina is 41 inches. This is quite distinct in shape and size to the traditional Chitravina, which is 50 inches long and has two chambers. The main resonator of the Chitravina is about 13 inches at its widest point. A secondary resonator is made of a gourd. It contains six melody strings and three secondary strings for maintaining drone. The remaining strings are sympathetic and run parallel to and below the melody strings. The playing length (distance from the bridges) is 32 inches. The Navachitravina has 20 strings. There are six melody strings and three secondary strings for maintaining the drone. The remaining 11 strings are sympathetic and run parallel to and below the melody strings. It is capable of being played at a higher pitch than the chitravina. While the latter is normally tuned anywhere between E and 0#, the Navachitravina can go up to B, C and slightly higher, at times. Its tone is brighter, slightly sharper with more mid and high ranges, which makes it attractive to listeners. This pitch and tone makes the Navachitravina a much better option for jugalbandis or collaborative concerts with other instruments such as sitar, guitar, sarod and also male vocalists. The pitch of B to C is much more convenient for accompanying artistes of violin, mridangam etc as opposed to 0-0# of the chitravina. The Navachitravina's size and playing length makes it possible to use standardized high quality guitar strings from any part of the world. The smaller playing length also enables the artiste to cover a greater range within a given time, i.e., enables one to play at much greater speeds more effectively. The unique playing length also reduces the strain on the artiste considerably. The distinct and novel size makes it much more inviting for women and children to learn and master. The novel shape and size of the navachitravina also facilitates easier transportation. Image 0/0

AB    NOVELTY - The system (30) has a gimbal assembly (40) with a pair of gimbals that reorient a payload by pivotal movement about two nonparallel axes. A fan e.g. axial fan, is positioned to drive airflow selectively along a surface of the gimbals. The gimbal includes a tunnel, and the fan is disposed in the tunnel. The payload detects electromagnetic radiation, and the gimbals are separated by a gap (60). The fan is positioned to drive an air via the gap. A controller operates the fan according to a temperature measured by a temperature sensor operatively coupled to the controller.
   USE - Used for mounting a device e.g. imaging system and laser system, as payload such as camera, and on a support platform e.g. vehicle such as aircraft vehicle e.g. fixed-wing piloted aircraft, pilotless remote-controlled aircraft, helicopter such as hovering helicopter, drone, missile, dirigible, aerostat balloon and rocket, watercraft vehicle such as boat, carrier and submarine, and ground vehicle e.g. car, parked car, truck, motorcycle and tank, fixed support platform such as building, observation tower and observation platform, and in navigation, targeting, search and rescue, law enforcement, firefighting, and/or surveillance.
   ADVANTAGE - The fan is positioned to drive airflow selectively along the surface of the gimbals, thus cooling the system and potentially allowing the operation at higher ambient temperatures. The system reduces the tendency of the payload to overheat, thus improving the thermal regulation of a vehicle-mounted payload when the vehicle is moving and stationary, and providing a lower cost solution to thermal regulation of a sealed payload.

AB    NOVELTY - The method involves scanning angular sectors, by an antenna beam during a monitoring mode, in which a radar e.g. side looking antenna radar (SLAR), performs detection, localization, and analysis of a trajectory of objects (11) e.g. ship, located in a scanned zone. Another set of angular sectors are scanned by the beam during a mapping mode, where the radar performs mapping of the zone in the latter set of sectors, by processing a high resolution image e.g. synthetic aperture radar image, of zones (12) extending in a progression direction (13) of an aircraft (14).
   USE - Used for operating a pulsed radar embarked on an aircraft e.g. drone type surveillance aircraft or helicopter, for detecting and mapping of maritime, terrain and coastal band (claimed), aerial inspection of a harbor area to detect number of ships and boats moored in the harbor or cove, monitoring/tracking the ships and boats circulating in a considered zone and mapping lateral zones adjacent to the trajectory of the ship and boat, and detecting and mapping hydrocarbon type pollutant product slick e.g. oil slick, obtained due to emptying of fuel oil tank by the ship, loss of a container by the ship and wreck of the ship.
   ADVANTAGE - The method simultaneously performs the monitoring of the ships and boats, and the mapping of the pollutant product slick.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - Images constituted are associated to form the high resolution image of the zone of the surface extending on both sides of the progression direction of the aircraft.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows an operational context of a pulsed radar operating method.

The explosive material can be trinitrotoluene, ammonium nitrate, potassium nitrate, nitrocellulose or nitroglycerine. The illegal drugs can be cocaine or heroine. The detector module has spectrograph detecting secondary fluorescent signature from out-gassing material.
   USE - Used as e.g. field mine detector, three-dimensional ultraviolet imager in a low flying manned aircraft, tethered balloon, drone (claimed) e.g. robotic or remotely controlled unmanned vehicle, simple robot land rover, and for remotely detecting secondary fluorescent signature of an explosive e.g. bomb, firearm, and illegal drugs e.g. cocaine, heroine.
   ADVANTAGE - Illuminates a person, without knowledge, within a crown from a predetermined distance to detect illegal drugs and other substances e.g. bomb, firearm even in a very cold weather while distinguishing specific propellant vapor from background ambient gas molecules under predetermined conditions, thereby reducing crime e.g. terrorist attack and improving security. Operates in a differential mode to suppresses electrical noise problems or interferences and provides a high degree of immunity to continuous, low-level random background noise. Seals an enclosure such that illumination module is not damaged by water or other harsh environments. Filters signals from ambient nitrogen oxide molecules in combat situations or urban areas to accurately determine specific characteristic properties of out-gassing material plume. Designs illumination module and detector module to run on portable batteries and occupy a small volume, requires minimal telemetry requirements and would not require support even when approaching a cell phone.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM for a detecting method of out-gassing material e.g. explosive material, illegal drugs.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The figure shows a schematic representation of the emission detector.

AB    NOVELTY - The method involves calculating optimal paths connecting passage points, where one path corresponds to reduced traveling time between two given points. An optimal itinerary is determined from the paths, where the itinerary is defined as an association, in a defined order responding to constraints of a mission, of the paths permitting to move from a starting point to a destination point in a time compatible with a duration of the mission. Speed of a vehicle e.g. drone, is modulated along the itinerary to consider presence of mobile obstacles, whose path cut the itinerary, in a given space.
   USE - Used for planning a path of a drone, in accordance with a mission committed to the drone and a given space (claimed), in which the mission is placed, for monitoring a territory. Can also be utilized for a terrestrial vehicle or vehicle used by an individual or group of individuals.
   ADVANTAGE - The method permits to determine the optimal path of the vehicle in an automatic, rapid and dynamical manner in order to allow the vehicle to carryout the mission to be made in determined locations during given time intervals, while considering the autonomy of the vehicle and constraints such as mobile obstacles and fixed obstacles e.g. mountains and turbulence zones, so as to avoid localized windy disturbances.

AB    NOVELTY - The assembly has a cylindrical duct element (21) receiving gas and communicating in downstream with two duct elements (22, 23). Each element (22, 23) communicates with duct elements (25, 27), which opens in axial semi-pipes (24, 26) for ejection of gas. The element (25, 27) forms a bend defined by a part guiding a gaseous flow in a radial direction remote from an axis of aircraft and another part in downstream of the former part guiding the flow in radial direction towards the axis in so that hot zones inside the pipe in upstream of the assembly is not visible from the back.
   USE - Used in an aircraft e.g. single or two engine aircraft, propelled by a hot gas produced in an axis of aircraft by a jet engine, and a military drone, for propelling gas exhaust (claimed) by ejection of gaseous flow.
   ADVANTAGE - The bending of the gaseous flows enables to efficiently shield a turbine disk of the jet engine and hottest parts which are provided in the downstream, thus providing the transition element which minimizes aerodynamic load losses by supporting gas mixture before exhaust, while efficiently reducing an infrared signature. The device permits to continuously ensure vectorisation of less amplitude without penalizing performance of the jet engine. The device is simple and functions with reduced number of fluid injection device, thus ensuring high reliability and less cost.

AB    NOVELTY - This invention belongs to the domain of machine visual technology. It claims a method used for calibrating the model parameter of single-camera virtual mouse system. This invention applies substantial drone coordinate system as medium to obtain the equation of the screen plane under camera coordinate system within non-vision field on the base of 2D substantial drone and 2D virtual drone. Meanwhile, the one to one mapping relationship between the image coordinates and the screen coordinates of the subpoint of the 3D space control point in the single-camera virtual mouse system is established by crossing the projective sightline and the space screen plane. The screen coordinates corresponding with the control point is provided as input to the computer system to control the computer. This method can be simply operated with high calibrating efficiency without assistant adjusting facility with high cost. It apply to spot calibration of single-camera virtual mouse system to greatly widen the range of the spot vision field of single-camera virtual mouse system and largely raise the real time performance.

AB    NOVELTY - The assembly (20) has a transition element (21) divided into two duct elements (22, 23) which communicate with semi exhaust nozzles (24, 26), where the divided nozzle part is visible from sides due to a bevel exhaust plane. The duct elements form bends in downstream of the transition element that is defined by two parts for guiding gaseous flow in radial directions, where the bends are symmetrical with respect to each other.
   USE - Used in an aircraft e.g. single or two engine aircraft or military drone, propelled by hot gas produced in an axis by a core engine e.g. turbo machine such as gas turbine engine and turboshaft engine (claimed).
   ADVANTAGE - The bending of the gaseous flows enables to efficiently shield a turbine disk of the turbojet engine and hottest parts which are provided in the downstream, thus providing the transition element which minimizes aerodynamic load losses by supporting gas mixture before exhaust. The divided nozzle part is visible from sides due to the bevel exhaust plane, thus efficiently reducing an infrared signature. The assembly allows to ensure guiding of the aircraft without a need for a tail unit and to ensure minimum transversal thrust of the exhaust nozzles during non-injection and non-vectorization, thus efficiently reducing an axial thrust loss.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a method for operating a propelling gas exhaust assembly.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a top view of a propelling gas exhaust assembly.

AB    NOVELTY - The assembly (20) has a duct connected to a pipe (24). The pipe forms a vertical bend defined by a part guiding gaseous flow in a radial direction of a vertical plane remote from an axis (XX) of an aircraft. The bend is defined by another part in downstream of the former part guiding gaseous flow in the radial direction towards the axis. The gaseous flow is brought in the axis in downstream of the bend, and axis of the pipe is coaxial to the axis (XX) of the gas flow in outlet of jet engine.
   USE - Used in an aircraft e.g. single or two engine aircraft, propelled by a gas flow produced in an axis of aircraft by jet engine, and military drone, for propelling gas exhaust (claimed) by ejection of gaseous flow.
   ADVANTAGE - The bending of the gaseous flow enables to efficiently shield a turbine disk of the turbojet engine and hottest parts which are provided in the downstream, thus providing the transition element, which minimizes aerodynamic load losses by supporting gas mixture before exhaust, while efficiently reducing an infrared signature. The device permits to continuously ensure vectorisation of less amplitude without penalizing performance of the jet engine. The device is simple and functions with reduced number of fluid injection device, hence ensuring high reliability and less cost.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a method for functioning an exhaust assembly.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a side view of a propelling gas exhaust assembly.

AB    NOVELTY - The aircraft (1) has a tail section (4A) with a curved surface extending around a proportion of circumference of a rotor (5), and a shroud fixed to the section. The tail section and the shroud are moveable relative to one another and about a rotor axis relative to a fuselage (2). Variable thrust is generated by movement of the tail section for controlling flight of the aircraft. The shroud slides over a portion of the tail section such that the proportion of circumference of the rotor and tail section`s curved surface vary as the tail section moves about the rotor axis.
   USE - Aircraft e.g. drone and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV).
   ADVANTAGE - The tail section and the shroud are moveable relative to one another and about the rotor axis relative to the fuselage, so that the movement of the tail section is vectored by rotating a wing casing, thus increasing the lift component while the thrust is reduced, and hence allowing the forward flight and vertical take off of the aircraft, and facilitating vertical landing of the aircraft.

AB    NOVELTY - The profile (1) has an envelope mounted on an infrastructure having a core (2) extending along a longitudinal axis of a transversal section of the hydrodynamic or streamlined profile. The core comprises an active section made of a composite material, deformed in a controlled and continuous manner under the effect of variation of temperature of an active layer inducing corresponding amplitude and direction deformation in zones of the envelope. A locking device (3) locks the profile in a deformed position.
   USE - Used for a forming a wing or blade integrated to an aeronautic or hydraulic structure e.g. drone, shuttle, flying structure, military aircraft, standard civil aircraft, windmill, turbine and helicopter.
   ADVANTAGE - The profile eliminates the need for retractable or pivotable shutters, mechanisms comprising an actuator, and hydraulic system or engines for ensuring the deformation of the profile, thus simplifying the structure of the profile and reducing weight of the profile. The locking device locks the profile in the deformed position such that energy required for maintaining the profile in its deformed state is reduced and utilization cost is reduced. The shape or the geometry of the profile can be modified such that the profile is easily adapted to utilization conditions to obtain specific trajectory or better penetration in fluid at gaseous state, vapor state or liquid state. The arrangement of the active zone permits to isolate the profile from environment thermal disturbances.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a sectional view of a deflection of a hydrodynamic or streamlined profile.

AB    NOVELTY - The vibrometer has a radiation source for coherent radiation, and a beam splitter to decompose an output beam of the source into a measurement beam for observing a vibrating object and into a reference beam. A beam guiding device superimposes the measurement beam returning from the object with the reference beam. A micro mirror grid (8) is arranged in the beam path of a returning measurement beam (18). A receiving optics (7) images the vibrating object on the grid, and an imaging optics (9) images the grid on a detector (10) which records superimposing patterns.
   USE - Used in military for identifying a vibrating object e.g. vehicle such as drone and aircraft, and building or a significant characteristic of the object based on its vibrating characteristics (claimed).
   ADVANTAGE - The micro mirror grid is arranged in the beam path of the returning measurement beam, the receiving optics images the vibrating object on the grid, and the imaging optics images the grid on the detector which records the superimposing patterns, thus avoiding the complex scanning process, and hence reducing the measurement time of the vibrometer and simplifying the structure of the vibrometer.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a method for determination of a vibration image of a vibrating object.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a schematic view a vibrometer with a micro mirror grid.

AB    NOVELTY - The system has an electromagnetic detection and locating radar (11) positioned on the ground. A multifunction transmit/receive radioelectric beacon (12) is carried in a guided aircraft e.g. drone, and transmits a continuous wave. The radar utilizes the wave transmitted by the beacon to perform passive locating for the measurement of the angular position of the aircraft. The beacon has a communication channel provided for periodically formulating and sending information to the aircraft by the beacon, enabling the aircraft to home into a landing trajectory from its position.
   USE - Used in aircraft field for guiding of autonomous and automatic aircraft such as drone, in an approach and landing phase, towards a landing area.
   ADVANTAGE - The utilization of the radar in the system allows the need to concentrate on a permanent and precise pointing of an object guiding beam, while allowing to automatically guide several aircrafts towards the landing area in a simple and simultaneous manner with a satisfying precision by using a minimum number of components. The radar utilizes the wave transmitted by the beacon to perform passive locating to improve the accuracy of measurement of the angular position of the aircraft. The communication channel of the beacon periodically formulates and sends the information to the aircraft by the beacon, thus enabling the aircraft to home into the optimal landing trajectory from its position in a simple manner. The radar has a large radiation pattern for intercepting several aircrafts without the need for proceeding to an aircraft search operation. The system can be installed on the landing area in a simple and easy manner and facilitates landing of the drone on temporary and improved landing area without the need for utilization of automatic landing assistance units. The system has a simple design, is inexpensive and has a large robustness with respect to climatic and geographical conditions than that of other devices.

AB    NOVELTY - The method involves determining altitude and relative precision of altitude using an altitude determination unit e.g. global positioning system (11) and radio altimeter (12), which does not utilize barometric pressure. The determined altitude is compared with a barometric altitude measured on board of an aircraft. An alert is generated when the difference between the determined and measured altitudes exceeds a predefined value. A setting value is proposed to a pilot of the aircraft after generating the alert.
   USE - Used for assisting in setting of barometric altitude of an aircraft (claimed) e.g. aircraft without pilot e.g. drone, military aircraft and civil aircraft such as business, regional and long range aviation.
   ADVANTAGE - The method improves the reliability of setting of the barometric altitude of the aircraft, and permits to assist the operation of aircraft towards isolated airfields whose air traffic agency is not in function so that the approach minima can be reduced. The method permits the semi-automatic and automatic setting of the barometric altitude.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a device permitting to implement barometric altitude setting assisting method. `(Drawing contains non-English language text)`

TI Sound attenuating exhaust muffler for internal combustion engine, has diverter plate with diverter and connecting member separate and distinct from baffle wall portion, where portion of connecting member are attached to diverter.
AU FORBES J
AE HEARTTHROB EXHAUST INC (HEAR-Non-standard)
GA 2007521408
AB    NOVELTY - The muffler has a diverter plate (30) dividing an internal volume of a casing (12) into two chambers (46, 48). The diverter plate has a diverter (50) and a connecting member that is separate and distinct from a baffle wall portion (36). The baffle wall portion has a D-shape aperture (40) allowing fluid communication between the chambers. A portion of the connecting member is attached to the diverter. The diverter is positioned such that exhaust gasses flowing through the aperture are deflected against a deflecting surface of the diverter.
   USE - Used for internal combustion engine.
   ADVANTAGE - The utilization of the connecting member allows cancellation of soundwaves and vibrations in the diverters without requiring the diverters to be attached to the casing. The utilization of the diverter reduces the amount of drone and noise experienced outside of the muffler, so that the vibration experienced by the diverters is not directly imparted to the casing. The design configuration of the muffler produces desirable sound characteristics throughout the engine speed range while providing sufficient noise attenuation and allowing sufficient flow and power characteristics, in a cost effective manner and with less labor intensive. The muffler allows a high flow rate with minimal drone at cruising speeds.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a method of making a muffler.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a muffler.

AB    NOVELTY - A sealing structure covers the cut-away portion (60) of the speaker enclosure (50), so as to tightly seal the internal space of the speaker enclosure. A diaphragm (31) surrounded by the cut-away portion vibrates due to bending elasticity while a near portion of connection portion (51c) formed as part of the contour serves as a point of support. The sealing structure attached to the diaphragm and a peripheral portion tightly seals the internal space of the speaker enclosure when the diaphragm vibrates.
   USE - For e.g. bass-reflex type and drone cone type loudspeaker systems.
   ADVANTAGE - The extended connection portion of the speaker enclosure ensures that the loudspeaker outputs sufficient bass components irrespective of its small size, prevents rolling or rocking and increases Q of the vibration of the diaphragm.

AB    NOVELTY - The method involves characterizing a static pressure sensor (40) and a total pressure sensor (50) to determine a static pressure sensor error (Pse) and a total pressure sensor error (Pte). A ratiometric characterization is performed by a software module (20) to reference a total pressure (Pt), to the static pressure sensor error, where Ptt is the actual total pressure (Pta), plus a total pressure sensor error (Pse). Temperature and pressure data provided by the sensors are stored. The two sensors are independently characterized.
   USE - Used in a sensor characterization system, for characterizing a pressure sensor that is utilized in an air data system that is used for measuring air data parameters e.g. altitude, velocity and Mach number, in an air vehicle, such as missile, drone, and unmanned aerial vehicle.
   ADVANTAGE - The utilization of the ratiometric characterization allows errors in the total pressure to be adjusted to match the errors in the static pressure such that the errors essentially are the same for each static and total pressures, thus canceling the errors in a much higher accuracy for the air data parameters originating from the sensors.

AB    NOVELTY - The mirror (44) receives and reflects the image data reflected by a mirror (42). A mirror (46) receives and reflects the image data reflected by the mirror (44). The positioner (48'') e.g. piezoelectric devices perform precise adjustment in the position and orientation of the mirror. The mirror (44) defines an axis forming a non-zero intersecting angle with the axis defined by the mirror (42).
   USE - For imaging system supported by moving support e.g. helicopter, airplane, glider, dirigible, balloon, drone, boat, car, truck, motor cycle, missile, rocket, satellite and/or other vehicle to produce composite images particularly for fire fighting, aeronautics and surveillance applications.
   ADVANTAGE - Improves image resolution, compensates for platform motions and improves image tracking. Avoids the need for additional optical components, achieving compactness. Manufacturing cost is reduced. Reduces the motion required for stabilization or dithering.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The figure shows a block diagram of the image stabilization system.

AB    NOVELTY - The method involves collecting pulse descriptors generated by radio receivers, where the descriptors have a set of characteristics specific to a given pulse. The pulse descriptors are correlated for accomplishing the generation of correlated pulse descriptors for each pulse of each radio signal intercepted from collected pulse descriptors. The correlated pulse descriptors are filtered by application of filters, where each filter has a set of criteria.
   USE - Used for fusion of output information of radio receiver e.g. instant wide band receiver and narrow band receiver , that is utilized in a self-shielding system for detecting radio signals emitted by radar, where the system is used for protecting an aircraft, ship and drone against threats representing the hostile radars or missiles.
   ADVANTAGE - The method permits to trigger the actions adapted in an optimum delay after the detection of the radio signal, thus permitting to optimize the implantation of the narrow band receiver while reducing its utilization when the instantaneous wide band receiver does not permit to characterize the radio signal.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a radio receiver system.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a method for fusion of output information. `(Drawing contains non-English language text)`

AB    NOVELTY - The procedure consists of scanning an area of the terrain by a laser beam (10) on the munition or sub-munition (6), observing a potential target (1) from a passive observation unit (4), such as a drone (5), and delivering a confirmation order or range-finding information to the munition or sub-munition when the observation unit detects the laser beam, directing it onto the target. The munition or sub-munition cannot be fired at the target before the confirmation order is received.
   USE - Controlling the release, firing, trajectory correction or firing direction for air-to-ground munition or sub-munition.
   ADVANTAGE - The procedure allows for higher-speed scanning and more reliable remote control.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows the systems used in the procedure.

AB    NOVELTY - The device has inflatable bags each associated with a conduit (15) that intakes and discharges an inflation fluid, and with a plate (7) fixing the bag to the underside of an aircraft. A partition (8) divides each bag into a compartment (9) connected to the conduit and a compartment (10) connected to the compartment (9) through a check valve (11). Each valve is fixed to the partition such that the fluid flows in a unidirectional manner from the compartments (9) to the compartments (10).
   USE - Used in a pilotlsess aircraft e.g. drone, for establishing contact between the aircraft and a receiving area (claimed) e.g. ground and aquatic area.
   ADVANTAGE - The check valves permit the inflation fluid introduced into the compartments, connected to the conduits, to also spread into the other set of compartments in order to ensure the inflation of both the sets of compartments. The former set of compartments deflates, when the aircraft touches the surface of the receiving area e.g. aquatic area, while the fluid is retained in the latter set of compartments which remain inflated, thus allowing to ensure ground clearance for the aircraft or the buoyancy of the aircraft.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for an aircraft which is equipped with an aircraft and receiving area contact establishing device.

AU BAKER J

AB    NOVELTY - The apparatus has a heat chamber (12) with a large opening near an upper end, where the chamber has multiple heat tubes (14) through which hot air is passed. A commodity is downwardly migrated around the heat tubes towards a floor of the heat chamber. A heat generator generates heat, where the commodity contacts a burner flame indirectly. Multiple rotors are combined with a bottom end of the chamber, and non-driven shafts comprise multiple non-driven drone wheels, where the rotors allow passage of a portion of the commodity from the chamber.
   USE - Used in an asphalt plant for treatment of a recyclable commodity e.g. asphalt (claimed) and portland cement (concrete) that are utilized for hard surfacing of a roadway or parking lot.
   ADVANTAGE - The apparatus enables continuous loading and unloading of the asphalt by buffering the commodity and metering hot mix ingredients. The commodity is downwardly migrated around the heat tubes towards the floor of the heat chamber, thus ensuring proper mixing and even heating. The commodity contacts the burner flame indirectly, thus reducing overheating of the commodity, facilitating re-melting of the asphalt without driving off the more volatile light hydrocarbons in the asphalt, and producing a dry product. The non-driven shafts comprise non-driven drone wheels, thus aiding in the mixing and breaking of the commodity. The apparatus is adapted for transport to jobsites where damaged pavement is processed and re-applied, thus effectively reducing the asphalt recycling cost for contractors, and hence reducing the amount of waste asphalt sent to landfills.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a perspective view of a commodity recycling apparatus.

AB    NOVELTY - The nozzle has an upstream end (12) with two cylindrical pivots (22) diametrically opposite and exterior to the nozzle. Each pivot is connected to a conduit (16) of an engine of an aircraft by an elastically deformable mono block articulation unit (24) with small dimensions. A displacement unit has an actuator mounted to the exterior of the nozzle on the conduit, where the rotation of the nozzle occurs in two directions around a transversal axis which is the yaw axis of the aircraft and is controlled by the actuator.
   USE - Used in an engine of an aircraft e.g. drone (claimed).
   ADVANTAGE - The dimension of the elastically deformable mono block articulation unit is small and so the unit is light and simple in structure, reliable, inexpensive and is easily mounted at the exterior of the nozzle. The articulation unit is a mono block without comprising a moving part, thus preventing the risk of seizing and blockage during a prolonged period of storage. The articulation unit has a property to filter and damp out the vibrations and jerks during the operation and does not require any maintenance. The arrangement of the nozzle allows the aircraft to be stored over long periods without maintenance and improves the maneuverability of the aircraft. The rotation of the nozzle occurs in two directions around the transversal axis, thus directing the aircraft towards the left or right-hand side compared to the longitudinal axis of the engine, and eliminating the drifts of the aircraft to improve the stealth of the aircraft.

AB    NOVELTY - The system (100) has an optical path with a matrix sensor forming an image of a scene, where each image corresponds to an instantaneous field centered about a line of sight. The path has a device for deflecting the line of sight at a specific speed for the function of target designation and illumination through scanning. An additional device deflects light at a speed for the function of air reconnaissance through counter scanning.
   USE - Used in a target designating and/or illuminating pod and in an optoelectronic turret to be fixed to an aircraft, drone or a helicopter, for designating and/or illuminating a target in a scene and for air reconnaissance.
   ADVANTAGE - The devices in the system permit to group the functions of target designation and/illumination and air reconnaissance in a single target designating and/or illuminating pod which is very small, has less weight and is compatible with the evolutions of an aircraft during flight, thus ensuring lesser cost of the system. The system avoids the usage of another aircraft, thus permitting a gain in time. Scanning and counter scanning ensure the stability of the overall scanning during the integration time.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a method for air reconnaissance for forming images.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a target designation and/or illumination system. (Drawing includes non-English language text).

AB    NOVELTY - The method involves guiding electromagnetic waves of an electromagnetic wave radiating assembly in a cylinder supported on the assembly. A target is illuminated in a near field zone such that the distance (R) between the assembly and the target is given by a relation involving the diameter (D) of radiating surface, greater than 5 square meter, of the assembly and the wavelength (lambda) of the emitted radiation as parameters.
   USE - Used in a high power microwave (HPM) weapon system and an electromagnetic power radiating system e.g. defense system such as radar, for implementing an electromagnetic wave radiating assembly that radiates electromagnetic waves of certain giga hertz (GHz), of emitted power greater than 100 mega watt (MW) and having a kilometric or higher range (claimed) to determine the position, size, shape, speed and direction of an object e.g. aircraft such as drone, and missile, in the space attacking a site or a target e.g. boat, where the high power microwave weapon system form part of weapon systems classified in directed energy weapons category.
   ADVANTAGE - The target is illuminated in the near field zone such that the distance between the electromagnetic wave radiating assembly and the target is given by a relation involving the radiating surface diameter and the wavelength of the emitted radiation as parameters, so as to avoid any attenuation of the electromagnetic field according to the distance, inside the cylinder. The method therefore allows to obtain intense and guided electromagnetic beams.

AB    NOVELTY - Combination of polarized laser source, polarized beam splitter mirror and quarter Lambda wave plate is adopted in the 2D photoelectric autocollimation tube, which uses characteristic of polarization to avoid that measuring light beam feeds back laser source, to prevent further angle drift of the measuring light. Obtaining measurement signal of 2D variance in small angle, beam splitter type target detector also obtains angle drift component of separated and fed back light beam. The said component is identical to inherent component of laser source. Monitoring device monitors quantity of angle drift. Based on quantity of angle drift obtained, computer control 2D optical beam deflection device in real time to adjust the measuring light beam according to direction opposite to quantity of angle drift.
   USE - For autocollimation.
   ADVANTAGE - The invention restrains and eliminates quantity of angle drift coupled in measuring light beam in propagation path of the measuring light beam.

AB    NOVELTY - The assembly has a liquid lubricant injector (32) fed with a non-recycled liquid lubricant. A liquid lubricant injector (42) is fed with a liquid lubricant drained through a groove (38) which collects the lubricant drained from drain orifices (24) passing through an outer ring (12) of a bearing (10). The groove communicates with a duct (40) connected to the injector (42) and with a duct (48) evacuating surplus drained liquid lubricant.
   USE - Used in a turbo shaft engine e.g. turbojet, of an aeronautical vehicle e.g. missile and launch system (claimed), utilized for launching a drone. Can also be used in a non-aeronautical vehicle.
   ADVANTAGE - The groove which collects the lubricant drained from the orifices communicates with two ducts connected to the injector and evacuating surplus drained lubricant, respectively, so that the lubricant is automatically fed in the duct before being reintroduced in the injector and the surplus lubricant is evacuated outside the assembly, without requiring a pump in a liquid lubrication path. The injector thus generates an automatic injection of the liquid lubricant drawn from the drain orifices, without requiring large and expensive units such as pump or filter, and hence avoiding the situations in which the assembly is fed at high pressure and the total added quantity of the lubricant is too high and completely incompatible with operation at high speed. The assembly is inexpensive, lightweight and has reduced encumbrance, and allows a greater global flow of the liquid lubricant.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for an aeronautical vehicle having a turbo shaft engine with a bearing assembly.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows an enlarged longitudinal sectional view of a bearing assembly.

AB    NOVELTY - The device has a case (10), to be handled by a user, including isotonic sensors (20) with 3 degrees of freedom. The sensors generate signals representative of the inclination of the case along its pitch axes, roll axes and yaw axes. The case has an isometric sensor (30) to generate a control signal to control an action in a virtual space. The control signal is a signal representative of a force exerted along an axis of the sensor (30).
   USE - Used for navigation in a three dimensional space (claimed) e.g. virtual space and real space, to explore and search a three dimensional database e.g. geographical database, and to inspect and manipulate a movable remote controlled object e.g. camera, aircraft, drone type aircraft, helicopter, remote controlled boat moving on water and person moving on ground e.g. in a building or in a city, or water, and an observation point in the space, in a video game.
   ADVANTAGE - The device permits to decouple the actions of the isometric and isotonic sensors in the same case handled by the user, thus allowing the user to control the navigation in the three dimensional space in an intuitive manner. The isometric sensor enables to obtain a gradual action according to a degree of freedom in the three dimensional space, proportional to the force exerted along the axis of the isometric sensor. The isometric sensor therefore permits to take into account the force exerted by the user on it in order to improve the performances and realism of the navigation in three dimensional space. The decorrelated association of the isometric sensor and the isotonic sensor in the same case allows the device to navigate according to six degrees of freedom in the three dimensional space. The device permits to offer to the user an intuitive gesture and an ergonomics in the movement of the hand. The device can be handled easily using a finger of only one hand, thereby enabling to navigate in the three dimensional space or to handle an object in the three dimensional space in an intuitive manner.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included for the following:
   (A) a system for navigation in a three dimensional space
   (B) a method for navigation in a three dimensional space.

AB    NOVELTY - The system has an omnidirectional optical sensor (10) with an orientable camera covering horizon of a ship (12) to acquire images of a new dangerous object present on a sea surface. An image processing unit extracts angular coordinates such as azimuth and site, of each image of the object, while eliminating waves and foam. An anti-collision analysis unit triggers a visual and audible alarm when the object is detected.
   USE - Used to be installed aboard a marine vehicle (claimed) such as a ship armed by professional, a pleasure boat and a naval drone, and in a coastal navigation channel such as buoy, lighthouse, beacon or jetty, for alerting about a risk of collision in sea.
   ADVANTAGE - The system can operate automatically without requiring any action of an operator, after departure of the ship and allow automatic triggering of visual and audible alarm for efficiently controlling the collision of the vehicle. The system has reduced encumbrance, can be adapted to any type of ship without specific infrastructure and allows to permanently search the marine vehicles and potentially dangerous obstacles at 360 degrees, and allows automatic measurement of the azimuths of the marine vehicles and visible obstacles. The system can be used in the pleasure boat with safety and comfort of the crew, in the absence of radar.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a method for anti-collision analysis by processing images coming from an omnidirectional optical sensor in an anti-collision alert system installed aboard a marine vehicle.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows an anti-collision alert system installed on a ship.

AB    NOVELTY - The system has a calculating unit for applying a method for normalizing contrast of an image (x). The image is segmented into blocks, and a calculation algorithm (NAC) is applied on the image to produce a correspondence table of levels on the image. The algorithm is applied on each block to produce a correspondence table of levels per block. A linear filtering is applied on a zone including the blocks.
   USE - Used for processing an image of an electro-optical forward looking infrared pod, gun sight, drone type airborne products, provided by an infrared sensor, in a zone e.g. field, vegetation, sky, and sea.
   ADVANTAGE - The system allows better visualizing the details of the images, prevents generation of harmful light effects such as laser attack, missile departure, flare pot, petrol well in fire and lightning of a lighter near the sensor, reduces flare zone in the recorded image after reducing the dynamics and allows distinguishing details of flaring source.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a schematic of a method for normalizing and enhancing contrast in an image.

AB    NOVELTY - The beacon has an auto-location module (17) with a radio location receiver for locating geographical coordinates, and a communication channel or device (24) for the transmission of the remote coordinates. A watertight container (22) having a positive buoyancy (23) integrates an acoustic transducer (18) and an acoustic module (19). An anchoring device (20) is adapted to anchor the container.
   USE - Used to be deployed by an aircraft in flight or by a ship, on the base of the sea for locating a diver or a sub-marine by radio-electric and acoustic waves.
   ADVANTAGE - The beacon does not require any human intervention to determine automatically and with precision its geographical coordinates, which are assimilated to the coordinates of the impact point of the beacon with the water surface. The beacon can be deployed in water of low depth, while the possible drift due to the current between the surface and the base is negligible compared to the required precision. The beacon weighs only some kilograms in the air and hence can be embarked and deployed easily and rapidly by aerial drone or by remote-controlled boat. The beacon, because of its auto-location, becomes operational from the time of its launching, and is economical in energy.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a process for deployment of a submarine acoustic beacon.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a view of different sub-assemblies composing a submarine acoustic beacon.

AB    NOVELTY - The drone has a propeller mounted in rotation in a shroud (10) around an axis closer to another propeller (26) and driven by a motor, so that the propellers are driven at same speed and opposite direction. A control surface includes pivoting cases (34) opened at their top and bottom ends and includes profiled wings (40). The cases are mounted pivotally around radial axes between the shroud and a lower part of a cylindrical body.
   USE - Miniaturized drone.
   ADVANTAGE - The design of the drone allows the propellers to be driven at same speed and in opposite direction in order to cancel the induced gyroscopic torque, optimizes aeraulic output, and allows controlling the drone in precise and stable manner. The use of profiled wings regularizes the flow of air in the cases forming the control surfaces and improves the dynamic lift of the drone as well as the efficiency of the drone. The control surface preserves their effectiveness in the event of wind. The design of the drone also stabilizes the trajectory of the drone in the event of strong incidence such as skid or turn, and stabilizes the drone at the time of takeoff and landing.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a schematic perspective view a miniaturized drone.
