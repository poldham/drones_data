AB    NOVELTY - The main wing plus fairing wing pneumatic layout with high lift-drag ratio features the main wings with relatively small thickness and on two sides below the fuselage, and fairing wings in the same shape as the main wings but greatly smaller size. The fairing wings have front edges backwards shifted relatively to those of main wings by the interval between the main wings and the fairing wings andslightly raised tail part, and are installed over the main wings. The layout results in great lift, less flying resistance and great available flying attack angle, less stall, high flying stability and other advantages, and may be used widely in different kinds of airplanes and drones.

AB    NOVELTY - The network has multiple sensors associated with multiple sensor control modules. The modules are capable of short range wireless communication with each other. A location unit determines the reasonably exact location of each module in the sensor network. A long range communication device (210) associated with one sensor control module communicates sensor data to a remote facility.
   USE - Used for monitoring of ice flow, potential lahars in glaciated area, or sensing presence of human in a remote or inaccessible area with airplane, helicopter and drone.
   ADVANTAGE - The multiple sensor control modules provides short range wireless communication with each other, thus alowing multiple sensors to be placed in an approximate location and enabling each sensor to self-determine and communicate their exact location to a central monitor. The network uses inexpensive sensor control modules, with limited processing power which in turn communicate with a central collector module having high processing power and communication capability.

AB    NOVELTY - The present innovation deals with medicinal preparations for increasing total and specific stimulation of animal body. The suggested preparation should be obtained out of drone bee larvae of different age. From the cells of drone bee brood one should cut off convex wax caps with a special knife for opening honeycombs, then due to light knocking one should remove larvae out of the cells into a cuvette to be put into vials. Larvae should be frozen and homogenized, moreover, as a stabilizing medium one should apply 5 %-glucose solution at 1:10 ratio at addition of 5 %-chloroform solution or 2 %-salicylic acid followed by sublimation to be finally poured into vials per 5 ml. Moreover, sublimation should be fulfilled in vacuum chamber at temperature of shelves' heating up to 30-45 degreesC. At achieving preparation temperature of 20-22 degreesC shelves' temperature should be decreased up to 25 degreesC to perform final heating for 22-24 hours. The method provides increased total and specific stimulation of animal body due to applying cheaper and more available biostimulant.
   USE - Veterinary science.
   ADVANTAGE - More simplified method of manufacturing.3 ex

AB    NOVELTY - The system has a pressure tank which communicates a gas through two passages, which provide an impingement flow to a compressor and a combustor flow to a combustor, respectively. A pyro-actuated valve (46) upstream of the passages initiates release of the gas from the tank until the tank is empty. A pressure regulator (48) shuts off the impingement flow, while blow down of combustor flow continues for an enhancement period.
   USE - Used in a gas turbine engine that is utilized for single usage application e.g. reconnaissance drone, cruise missile and decoy application such as air-launched and ground-launched weapon systems.
   ADVANTAGE - The blow down of the combustor flow continues to the combustor for the enhancement period, thus assuring reliable operation of the engine during high altitude launch, at low cost.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a method of starting an expendable gas turbine engine.

AB    NOVELTY - The method involves directing a damping force to a carriage (4) at a direction opposite to the direction of a launching force, to resist the movement of the carriage towards a releasing position (7), such that the magnitude of the damping force is dimensioned to maximum at the launching moment. The damping force is reduced to minimum after launching on a predetermined examination period.
   USE - For catapult used for launching unmanned aircraft e.g. drone, surveillance plane, missile.
   ADVANTAGE - Prevents generation of acceleration peaks exceeding the allowed acceleration limit, thereby preventing unmanned aircraft to be subjected to excessive accelerations causing damage. Acceleration stage of aircraft can be controlled without take-off damping.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included for the following:
   (A) a catapult for launching an unmanned aircraft; and
   (B) a locking device.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The figure shows the schematic side view of catapult provided with locking device.

TI Rotor brake for use in e.g. helicopter, has brake deactivation device with centrifugal clutch engaging drum to block drum axial movement when rotor shaft exceeds preset speed and to allow movement when shaft rotates below speed.
AU PODRATZKY A

AB    NOVELTY - The brake has a rotor speed-controlled, centrifugal force-actuated rotor brake deactivation device with a carrier device moveable relative to a brake disk to enable braking effect. A centrifugal clutch (K) engages a drum (8) of the device to block an axial movement of the drum when the rotor shaft (2) exceeds a preset speed and to allow the axial movement when the shaft rotates below a preset speed.
   USE - Used in conjunction with a tail rotor in a rotary-wing aircraft e.g. helicopter and rotary-wing drone.
   ADVANTAGE - The centrifugal clutch engages the drum to block and allow the axial movement of the drum based on the speed of the rotor shaft to enable or disable the braking effect, thus an undesired or inadvertent actuation of the rotor brake due to manual operating errors or malfunctions in the brake system itself is ruled out. A manual operating error of the rotor brake during flight of a rotary-wing aircraft and a malfunction due to a temperature-related increase in the pressure of a rotor brake hydraulic system are effectively avoided. A failure due to brake actuation at an excessive rotor speed or a structure change of safety-relevant brake components is hence prevented. The rotor brake deactivation device is relatively simple and inexpensive to realize in terms of design and production, also at a low weight, thus increasing the operational and flight safety of the rotary-wing aircraft.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a rotary-wing aircraft having a rotor brake.

AB    NOVELTY - The drone has egg-beater rotors placed in a drone body (1) and applying thrust forces on a gimbal joint. The gimbal joint is connected to a push bar situated between rotational planes of rotors. The gimbal joint enables back and forth movement of the rotors around two axes in a separate and simultaneous manner to position the center of thrust forces of the rotors near center of gravity of the drone.
   USE - Used in open or confined spaces for civil or military missions to observe and transmit visual data and/or signals, to sample specimen in hostile, perilous or difficult to access environments, to neutralize people and/or materials and to detect sensitive and dangerous materials.
   ADVANTAGE - The positioning of the center of thrust forces of the rotors close to the centre of gravity of the drone reduces the effect of perpendicular reactions due to outer influences such as gusts of wind and shock. The stability of the drone is thus improved while conserving the capabilities to fly horizontally in all directions to reduce the training duration and to facilitate the control and the implementation of the drone.

AB    NOVELTY - The device has a cylindrical sensor body (1) with a body capacitance. A power supply module (108a) has two input terminals, in which one terminal is coupled to the body and another terminal is coupled to a voltage line. An electronic circuitry is coupled to the module. The module converts power flow between the body and line into a supply of power at a voltage lower than voltage of the line for operation of the circuitry.
   USE - Used for transmission repeaters powered by the high voltage line and as an indicator e.g. aircraft warning light and information sign, radar device, mesh networking node, video/audio surveillance and sound emitting device for scaring animal and drone.
   ADVANTAGE - The module converts the power flow between the body and line into the supply of power at the voltage lower than the line voltage for operation of the circuitry without requiring a physical connection between two voltage potentials, and hence increasing reliability of the device even in low current conditions.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a method of powering an apparatus mountable coupled with a power line carrying a high AC line voltage.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a cross section of a body capacitance electric field powered device.

AB    NOVELTY - The method involves acquiring a first spectral image of a scene that includes the target, designating a spectral reference window, in the first spectral image, that includes a respective multiple pixel vectors, acquiring a second spectral image, of the scene, that includes a respective multiple pixel vectors, and hypercorrelating the spectral reference window with the second spectral image.
   USE - Used by e.g. unmanned aircraft, such as a surveillance drone, to track a target, such as enemy tank.
   ADVANTAGE - Provides target tracking method that is based on spectral images rather than on panchromatic images.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - A hypercorrelation function is obtained, wherein a maximum of the hypercorrelation function corresponds to a location of the target in the scene. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a target tracking system.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The figure is a schematic depiction of an unmanned aircraft using the target tracking method.

   BOHR I (BOHR-Individual)
GA 2005067231
AB    NOVELTY - In steering wire is incorporated special signal measuring bridge so set-up that command pulses at bridge output do not deliver any evaluatable measuring signal, while reference pulses, even at simultaneous operation, generate measuring signal at bridge output. Measuring signal is evaluated in pulse discriminator circuit, while locking logic, behind pulse discriminator prevents generation of pseudo reference pulses, which otherwise are formed in relation to so called command discharge pulses.
   USE - For earth installation of wire steered aircraft.
   ADVANTAGE - Double function of steering wire interface and resistance to direct clock interface.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are included for simultaneous reference pulse receiver.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The figure shows basic circuit diagram of simultaneous reference pulse receiver.

TI Optimum control method for approximating optimum control input to control dynamic systems in real time assigns an ambiance-sensitivity input vector to a database prepared beforehand.
AU ZANTZ T
AE BUNDESREPUBLIK DEUT BUNDESMIN VERTEIDIGU (BUND-C)
GA 2005059162
AB    NOVELTY - Within an environment of sensitivity (EOS) there is an optimum solution calculated beforehand and stored as an output vector in a database. This solution is invoked so as to produce an approximation, because within an EOS the same inequality conditions are continuously active and inactive for an optimum control problem that is to be solved for maintaining optimum control input.
   USE - For control systems like industrial robots, missiles, drones, reentry bodies, etc.
   ADVANTAGE - The optimum control problem is usually handled only numerically in real time and therefore cannot be calculated in real time. This guarantees the continuous progression of solutions for an environment of sensitivity.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a graph plotting percentage savings against applied mass. (Drawing includes non-English language text).

   ADVANTAGE - The apparatus attaches the restraint to the control surface to restrain the control surface in the stowed configuration and cuts the restraint to allow the control surface to move to the operational configuration, thereby properly maneuvering the launched vehicle`s ability and causing the vehicle to become aerodynamically or hydrodynamically stable.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included for the following:
   (A) a vehicle
   (B) a method of attaching a restraint to a control surface of the vehicle.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING - The drawing shows a perspective view of a vehicle having control surfaces in a stowed configuration.

AB    NOVELTY - The method involves receiving video signals from an initiating computer (104). The signals are transmitted via communication path (112) to a video server (102) that digitizes and compresses the signals using A/D conversion circuit and compression algorithm. The multicast video signals are transmitted to one or more video display devices (126, 146) e.g. standalone computer via a network e.g. Internet.
   USE - Used for transmitting video signals through a video transmission system (claimed), for transmitting both streaming video and telemetry data from drone aircraft to a server on the ground in military applications, or for use in educational environment e.g. for distributing a lecture occurring at an educational institution, to remote locations.
   ADVANTAGE - The method digitizes and compresses the received video signals, thereby effectively multicasting the video signals to remote locations. The method provides a compression algorithm which avoids redundancies both between successive frames of video and within each individual frame, and hence the amount of digital video signal data is reduced, thereby reducing the amount of digital data and decreasing a communication time and required bandwidth. The non-networked computer does not require any hardware or software modifications to be compatible with the video transmission system. The method securely broadcasts video and/or audio to remote participant equipment via a communications network and is expandable to accommodate any number of participants. The method transmits a video signal without any video signal degradation and provides a secure and reliable connection for all participants. The method provides the networked computer which does not require any hardware modifications, so that the video server can automatically download the client software to the computer through the network.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a block diagram of a hardware configuration of a multicast system in which a video transmission system is utilized to multicast presentation video signals from an initiating computer to multiple remote participant locations.

GA 2003829661
AB    NOVELTY - The method involves providing a path for fuel transfer and data lines by deployment tether. Guidance technology includes real-time inertial and positional sensor data to control a drones flight (100). The data may be computationally integrated through a Kalman filter or similar algorithm. The tethered drones are used to allow a substantial increase in separation between tanker and receiving aircraft (30).
   USE - Used for transferring fuel between air-borne vehicles e.g. helicopters and fixed wing aircraft.
   ADVANTAGE - The tethered drones in the refueling process allows a substantial increase in the separation between the tanker and the receiving aircraft, thereby lowering the risk of mid-air collision. The separation also reduces the risk of the tankers wake disturbing the flight path of the receiving aircraft, and enhances the safety and reliability of mid-air refueling.

GA 2003502634
AB    NOVELTY - A structural monitoring apparatus comprises a transceiver assembly connected to a power source, a sensor operatively connected to the structure for sensing a change in a selected condition of the structure, and a transmitter for transmitting an electromagnetic signal to a remote location in response to an electromagnetic radiation returned to the transceiver from the sensor.
   USE - For continuous integrity monitoring of large civil structures such as bridges and high-rise buildings. It is also useful for critical military structures, airframes, oil tankers, and naval vessels.
   ADVANTAGE - The invention has the ability to gather many often disparate data allowing them to be cross-correlated instantaneously. The entire pile system could be monitored full-time. And with a movement resolution as small as 5 mum, the state of the piles can be tracked and possible failure predicted, whether attached to bridge piers, oil rigs, historic buildings, or other structures with foundation support systems.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - A structural monitoring apparatus comprises:
   (i) a source of power,
   (ii) a transceiver assembly connected to the power source and adapted to transmit and receive electromagnetic radiation,
   (iii) a sensor (12) operatively connected to the structure for sensing a change in a selected condition of the structure, and
   (iv) a transmitter operatively connected to the transceiver for transmitting an electromagnetic signal to a remote location which is in response to the electromagnetic radiation returned to the transceiver from the sensor.
   The sensor has a first element for being connected to a first part of the structure and which moves relative to the first element as a result of the change in the selected condition. The sensor is operatively connected to the transceiver for receiving and returning the electromagnetic radiation to the transceiver. The returned radiation is indicative of the change in the selected condition of the structure.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The figure is a diagrammatic general view of an optical monitoring system.
   Pulses of light (4)
   Optical fiber (8)
   Sensor (12)
TF TECHNOLOGY FOCUS - INSTRUMENTATION AND TESTING - Preferred Components: The sensor is digital having the capability to undergo a physical change in response to a change in the selected condition. It returns the pulses of electromagnetic radiation to the transceiver in digital on/off mode in accordance with the state of the sensor. The electromagnetic signals received by the transceiver are automatically correlated with one another for verification purposes. The transceiver transmits the pulses of light (4) continuously for constant monitoring of the structure. The transceiver is connected to each sensor by optical fiber (8). A drone cable may be connected to the structure and operatively connected to the optical sensors so that a change in a selected condition is transmitted to each sensor.
   TECHNOLOGY FOCUS - POLYMERS - Preferred Materials: The drone cable is made of aramid fibers.

AB    NOVELTY - An imager captures a pair of images having reflected signals from illuminated and non-illuminated field of view, respectively. The imager captures one of the images while the other image is still captured in the imager. A microprocessor coupled to the imager, generates a subtraction image of the field of view as the pixel difference between the pair of images.
   USE - For measuring relative positions of objects with retroreflective surfaces such as in taillight of cars, trucks, motorcycles, and roadway lane markers. Also for commercial aircraft, military drones and in railroads, factories.
   ADVANTAGE - Illuminator is used hence dependence on ambient light conditions, is reduced. Use of image subtraction process greatly simplifies the final image and reduces the computational complexity of the ranging software. Uses high-resolution imager that allow the tracking of multiple targets at the same time.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for object ranging method.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The figure shows a flowchart explaining the object ranging method.

AB    NOVELTY - The aerial comprises two sheets of wires lying symmetrically with respect to a median plane. The sheets each consist of a mesh of conductive wires, arranged in a web of ellipses, linked by radial lines. The ellipses are stacked one inside another, with their radii increasing according to a geometric progression. All ellipses on one side are linked together with radial links, and supplied at a single connection point.
   USE - Wide band aerial for use on military drone.
   ADVANTAGE - Provides wide band and omni-directional detection for military signal gathering.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The aerial is made up from two sheets of conductive wires (N, N') which are plane or slightly curved, lying symmetrically with respect to a median plane. The sheets may be elliptical, and may be made up from a number of ellipses stacked one inside another, linked by radial lines (R). The ellipses (E) and the radial lines (R) are conductors forming a conductive mesh whose dimensions increase progressively from their single supply points (A, A'). The aerial has no matching load reducing its efficiency, but is matched to that of the transmitter (G), generally at 50 ohms, via a wide band asymmetric output transformer (T). The large and small axes of the ellipses (2a0, 2a1 ..., 2b0, 2b1 ...) are arranged in geometric progression.

AU O'DONNELL F E

GA 2002433430
AB    NOVELTY - Reducing (M1) viral replication (VR) in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patient by administering a T-cell (I) made incapable of hosting VR and having increased cell surface membrane density of viral receptors (II), is new. It involves reducing host stem cell (SC) population and repopulating marrow with autologous SC/placental blood, that lack normal expression of gene encoding (II).
   USE - For reducing viral replication in HIV-infected patient (claimed). The method is useful for reducing risk of drug resistance in HIV infection during course of antiviral treatment for retrovirus infection by suppressing viral load through use of novel hematopoietic cells.
   ADVANTAGE - The method reduces the viral battleground to the micro-environment of single cell by first designing a host cell that is devoid of the infrastructure or function necessary for viral replication. This host cell has the surface receptors (CD4) in a normal or even increased density required for retroviral incorporating into the host cell. These modified lymphocytes are used to soak up virons into a sterile environment during a multidrug regimen. By reducing the opportunity for drug resistance mutations, the method can be used to eradicate or significantly suppress the infection. Also, the method purposely eliminates or reduces normal stem cell population which ultimately produces the lymphocytes susceptible to viral replication. Also the method allows repopulation of bone marrow with stem cells that produce lymphocytes lacking CKR-5 receptors.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for preparing (M2) host cells that are devoid of infrastructure required for viral replication, comprising:
   (1) isolating mononuclear target cells from a host;
   (2) performing in vitro treatment of the target cells with a multi-drug array of antivirals and/or ionizing radiation chemotherapy to render the target cell's replicative infrastructure ineffective; and
   (3) reinfusing the resulting autologous mononuclear cells and mono nuclear stem cells.
TF TECHNOLOGY FOCUS - BIOTECHNOLOGY - Preferred Method: In (M1), preferably, the density of CD4 viral receptors on T lymphocytes for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), has been increased. The autologous stem cells or placental blood lack a normal expression of gene encoding CKR-5 HIV receptor. Reducing or eliminating normal host stem cell population is carried out by ionizing radiation or chemotherapy. (M2) preferably involves isolating mononuclear target cells (CD4+ target cells) by leukophoresis techniques, preforming in vitro treatment of target cells with multi-drug array of antivirals which comprise drugs such as protease inhibitors, reverse transcriptase inhibitors, nonsense nucleotides or fusion inhibitors and/or ionizing radiation such as gamma radiation or ultraviolet radiation, chemotherapy to render the target cells replicative infrastructure ineffective, and reinfusing the resulting autologous mononuclear cells and mononuclear stem cells (lacking CKR-5 genes). The mononuclear cells may be harvested and stored in vitro. Preferably, the protein synthesis in the target cells is blocked by pretreatment of the cells with the pharmacologic inhibitor of protein synthesis, and the autologous mononuclear cells are treated through use of chemotherapy (to reduce any viral replication) or multi-drug array of antivirals. in vitro treatment of target cells is performed in solution containing surface receptors.
   WIDER DISCLOSURE - (1) a lymphocyte target cell (drone lymphocyte) in which cellular mechanisms required for viral replication are inactivated or deleted; and
   (2) a lymphocyte target cell (cruise lymphocyte), where its pretreatment with multidrug array of antivirals enhances the ability of the virus to replicate, particularly after the cellular mechanisms have been treated to inactivate or delete viral replication.
   ACTIVITY - Anti-HIV.
   No biological data is given.
   MECHANISM OF ACTION - Cell therapy; HIV replication inhibitor; viral load suppressor.
   ADMINISTRATION - To reduce viral load to below 200 copies/cubic mm, modified T lymphocyte targets are administered in concentrations of 1000-1000000 or more cells/cubic mm. The modified cells are administered before a significant reduction in CD4 T cell count.

TI Preparing host cells e.g. autologous lymphocytes, devoid of infrastructure required for viral replication, by treating cells in vitro, with multidrug array of antivirals and/or ionizing radiation, chemotherapy.
AU O'DONNELL F E

AB    NOVELTY - Preparing host cells that are devoid of infrastructure required for viral replication comprising isolating mononuclear target cells (T) from host, performing in vitro treatment of (T) with multi-drug array of antivirals and/or ionizing radiation, chemotherapy to render (T)'s replicative infrastructure ineffective, and harvesting resulting autologous lymphocytes and lymphocytic stem cells, is new.
   USE - For preparing host cells (CD+ autologous lymphocytes and lymphocytic stem cells) that are devoid of infrastructure required for viral replication (claimed) preferably, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) replication. The modified lymphocytes produced by the method are returned to the patient (HIV-infected patient) through the leukophoresis process, to reduce the viral load. The patient's normal population of susceptible lymphocytes is reduced by ionizing radiation and/or chemotherapy aimed at making the marrow aplastic. As part of the rescue therapy, stem cells lacking the CKR-5 gene or its normal expression are transplanted to the marrow. These stem cells can be autologous after undergoing in vitro reproduction and gene therapy or they can be homologous derivatives of placental blood after undergoing in vitro gene therapy to eliminate the CKR-5 receptors.
   ADVANTAGE - Treating the cells with multidrug array of antivirals makes it unlikely that the drug resistance will emerge. Also the step allows in vitro determination of concentrations of the antivirals that would be toxic intracellularly when administered systemically.
TF TECHNOLOGY FOCUS - BIOTECHNOLOGY - Preferred Method: The lymphocytes are isolated from the host by leukophoresis. The CD4+ autologous lymphocytes and lymphocytic stem cells are treated using multidrug array of antivirals. Preferably, the stem cells lack CKR-5 genes, and protein synthesis in the cells is blocked by pretreatment of the cells with a pharmacologic inhibitor of protein synthesis. Also the cells are subjected to an in vitro treatment in a solution containing CD4 surface receptors. The autologous lymphocytes or lymphocytic stem cells are subjected to ionizing radiation such as gamma radiation or ultraviolet radiation (to obtain drone lymphocytes, where the cytoplasmic and nuclear mechanism of the cells is incapable of supporting viral replication). The ionizing radiation-subjected cells are treated with multidrug array of antivirals which comprises at least a protease inhibitor or a reverse transcriptase inhibitor or a nonsense nucleoside (to obtain cruise lymphocytes which have an intracytoplasmic environment that is further hostile to the invading virions). The harvested lymphocytes are stored in vitro.
   ACTIVITY - Anti-HIV (human immunodeficiency virus).
   No biological data is given.
   MECHANISM OF ACTION - Cell therapy.
   ADMINISTRATION - The modified lymphocytes are administered in a count ranging from 1000-1000000 or more cubic mm, at a point of time before the viral load becomes sufficient to suppress the lymphocyte count significantly.
   EXAMPLE - None given.

AB    NOVELTY - A ground control apparatus (2) has a receiver (11) which receives the flight present position information and earth height transmitted by a transponder from a reconnaissance drone. An image processor (14) computes the outline of a topography based on the received information. A display unit displays the graphic representation of the outline of topography.
   USE - For collecting, analyzing and displaying the information of flight using night unmanned reconnaissance apparatus.
   ADVANTAGE - Since only pulse laser oscillator is mounted, cheap active type range finder is achieved. Since real time outline shapes such as topography is displayed, reconnaissance operation is easily implemented at night. Since economic burden is reduced sharply, the apparatus is also used for consumer applications like investigation of a calamity field and rescue operation at the time of accident.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - A barometric altimeter in flight sets elevation for flying. A detector detects the flight present position. A pulse laser oscillator measures the clearance with the surface of the earth based on the measured clearance and the elevation set. A transponder transmits the flight present position information and earth height to the ground control apparatus.

AU ZERWECKH S H
AE GEN ATOMICS AERONAUTICAL SYSTEMS INC (GEAT-C)
GA 1999403886
AB    NOVELTY - The wings (14,16) has a pair of inboard panels (18a,18b) attached to the fuselage (12) and extending along the wing axis and a pair of outboard panels (20a,20b) mounted onto the inboard panels, which can rotate about the wing axis. The outboard panels can be rotated during flight collectively or differentially. Empennage panels (24a,24b) are attached to the fuselage and can be rotated collectively or differentially.
   USE - The wing design is used in air vehicles which are convertible between configurations for the most efficient lift in either high speed or low speed flight regime. The wing is particularly designed for uses as airfoils fro an unmanned drone air vehicle.
   ADVANTAGE - The rotating panels allow the air vehicle to control the pitch, yaw and roll of the air vehicle. The outer wing panels and the empennage panels are interchangeable to minimize and simplify maintenance efforts and provides part commonality. The air vehicle is reliable and operationally easy controlled and easy and cost efficient to manufacture.

TI Aerial refueling method for unmanned aerial vehicle.
AU ECKSTEIN D
AE ECKSTEIN D (ECKS-Individual)
GA 1999383791
AB    NOVELTY - The method involves equipping both the drogue (16) of the refueling plane (10) and the probe (26) of the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) (24) with a laser receiver/transmitter (29,30), with that of the refueling aircraft emitting a laser generated cone shaped reticular pattern via a projection lens while that of the UAV switches between a range finder mode a pulse code modulation data link mode with which it transmits relevant information to the refueling aircraft.
   USE - For refueling unmanned aircraft during flight, particularly for 'stealth' style reconnaissance drones such as the Tier 2 plus Ryan 'Global Hawk' and the Tier 3 minus Lockheed 'Darkstar'. The system can also be used to tow a crippled unmanned aircraft to a point where it can be released to glide to a landing.
   ADVANTAGE - The system is inherently 'stealthy' as it does not transmit radio frequencies on any frequency and the laser emissions are highly directional, almost impossible to detect from the ground given the height that refueling operations would occur and have a specific frequency that a laser detector would require in order to detect it. Uses simple, low cost components and the refueling operation could increase the operational effectiveness of a reconnaissance drone, e.g. loiter time over its target, by up to ten or more times.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The method involves providing the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with a telescopically extendable probe that extends forwards along the direction of its flight path and is sized and shaped to engage a drogue trailed from a refueling aircraft. The probe and the drogue each include a laser transmitter/receiver tuned to a specific frequency outside of the visible spectrum that is radially offset from centerline of the probe or drogue respectively to allow boresighted alignment of the transmitter/receivers when the probe is telescopically received in the drogue receptacle. The transmitter/receiver in the UAV switches between transmitter and receiver modes, with the receiver mode including a range finder mode which determines where the probe is within the laser generated graduated cone shaped reticular pattern transmitted via a projection lens in the receiver/transmitter of the drogue and the distance from the probe to the drogue, with an automatic target recognition algorithm determining exactly where in the reticule beam the distal end of the probe is located.
   The receiver/transmitters on the probe and drogue are activated and the UAV is moved towards the refueling aircraft until it is within the laser reticule pattern, and the range finder mode of the UAV system is activated as the UAV is moved towards and into alignment with the receiver/transmitter of the refueling aircraft. The UAV is accelerated at a predetermined slow rate of approach to the refueling aircraft, and the mode of the UAV receiver/transmitter is switched to a timeshare mode where it operates for part of the time in the range finder mode and part of the time in a pulse code modulation data link mode that transmits information such as altitude, airspeed, rate of closure, fuel onload desired etc. to the refueling aircraft. Contact is established between the probe and the drogue where upon they are locked together.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - A side elevational schematic view of a refueling aircraft and an unmanned aerial vehicle fitted with the refueling alignment system.

AB       The propulsion unit comprises a ducted fan (1) driven by an IC engine (3) and surrounded by a streamlined housing (5) which ends in a duct (7), and a pulse jet engine (8) located inside the housing to the rear of the fan. The IC engine and pulse jet engine can be mounted on a common supporting frame (14), and the IC engine has an exhaust pipe (23) which discharges into the pulse jet engine and contains a fuel pipe feeding the pulse jet engine.
   The two engines can be fed with a common fuel, such as a methanol/oil mixture, or the IC engine can operate on such a mixture plus nitromethane if its ignition plug is incandescent, or on a petrol/oil mixture if ignition is controlled. The pulse jet engine can operate on pure petrol or kerosene or a methanol/benzol mixture plus nitromethane.
   ADVANTAGE -   Combines ducted fan and pulsed jet in one assembly for higher performance. The same fuel mixture can be used to power both the two types of engines.

GA 1998430212
AB       The determination of the angular velocities, roll, pitch and yaw (p,q,r) of an aircraft has a device for determination of the corresponding instantaneous roll, pitch and yaw angles of the aircraft using signals from position satellites or beacons, and then a device for determining the angular velocities from differential equations for the angles.
   Typically the signal capture is using a phase differential. groups receiver with three antennae (14, 16, 18). Determination of the angular velocities is ideally using a Kalman filtering algorithm based on an aerodynamic model of the flight of the aircraft.
   USE/ADVANTAGE -   E.g. for aeroplane, drone or missile. For instantaneous determination of aircraft attitude. Measurement of aircraft angular velocity is necessary to fly aircraft. Previously gyrometers were used, but these are susceptible to breakage during high acceleration. Use of system based on satellites or beacons overcomes this disadvantage.

AB       The reed is threaded for seating into the drone reed seat, and the bullet-shaped nose deflects air pressure evenly over the tongue. The reed fits into the bottom end of the drone which is then attached to a stock which is attached to the bag. The bag contains air which is placed there by the piper blowing into the bag via a blow stick which is also attached to the bag.
   With breath and arm pressure, the piper causes the air in the bag to be forced up through the drones. This forced air passes through the drone reed to give rise to sound. The reed has three components, the reed itself, a tongue, and a bridle to secure the tongue.
   ADVANTAGE -   The plastics construction ensures the sound is not affected by moisture so that the reed stays in tune regardless of moisture content. Double toning is eliminated.

AB       The system includes a control device (46) which calculates a pitch axis steering angle command to compensate for the difference between a vertical, i.e. lift, acceleration of the airplane measured by a vertical acceleration sensor (42) and a target turn acceleration and transmits it to a pitch axis manoeuvring device (28) to move e.g. the airplane elevators.
   A reference bank angle calculator (36) is responsive to the target turn acceleration command for calculating a reference bank angle (36) and generating a corresponding signal. An altitude controller is responsive to the altitude for calculating an altitude deviation of the airplane from a target altitude and a bank angle correcting quantity (34) from the altitude deviation and for generating a bank angle command signal (38) by correcting the reference bank angle signal using the bank angle correction quantity. The roll axis controller (18) is responsive to the bank angle command signal for calculating a bank angle deviation of the bank angle from the bank angle command and roll axis steering angle command for making the bank angle deviation zero and for transmitting the roll axis steering angle command to the roll axis manoeuvring device as a manipulated variable to control the airplane.
   USE -   Especially for controlling drone capable of holding fixed radius, fixed altitude and fixed speed by making steep turn of unmanned target plane to confirm and evaluate target tracking capability of missile.
   ADVANTAGE -   Attains precise control of airplane with high response ability and accuracy. Eliminates fluctuation in turn acceleration.

   (JP10016892-A)      The controller has a pair of operating devices (26,28) which controls rotary motion of a moving body along rotary/pitch axis, respectively. The altitude of the moving body is detected by a first sensor (14). The angular position of the moving body is detected by a second sensor (16). The longitudinal/vertical acceleration of the body is detected by a third sensor (42). The steering angle value of pitch axis corresponding to the zero acceleration difference of a target is calculated. A first control unit (46) outputs a control signal to a first operating device based on calculated value.
   A first operation unit (36) calculates a reference angle of the target, based on the detected acceleration of target. The altitude difference of the target is compared by a second operation unit (18), based on the output of the first sensor. A correct reference angle is computed based on the obtained difference value. The steering angle value of a rotary axis corresponding to a zero angle difference of the target is calculated. Based on the computed value, control signal is output to the first operating device, by a second control unit.
   ADVANTAGE -   Simplifies altitude control operation. Enables to perform rotation acceleration control directly. Prevents fluctuation in measurement operation. Controls evaluation of tracking capacity of target such as missile, efficiently.

TI Whip aerial for aircraft - has radiation transparent winding formed helically around aerial shaft, with foot of each shaft attached to aircraft body.
AU GIRAULT J M
AE MATRA DEFENSE SA (MATR-Non-standard)
GA 1997300748
AB       The aerial comprises at least one metal shaft (16a,16b) which is preferably cylindrical. The foot of each shaft is attached to the body of the craft to ensure it is orthogonal to the direction of displacement when the aerial is in use. A filament of material which is transparent to radiation and with diameter less than that of the shaft is wound around the shaft in a helical pattern. This causes a change from the laminar air flow past the aerial to turbulent air flow.
   The aerials may be arranged in pairs, so the two filaments wound around a pair of shafts have the same step between turns, and are wound in opposite directions. The filament diameter may be between 1/10th and 1/50th of that of the shaft. The resulting diameter of the filament is less than 1 mm, pref. between 0.5 and 0.8 mm.
   USE/ADVANTAGE -   E.g. pilotless drone. Reduced drag in air flow esp. for turbulent conditions.

AU WEBSTER J M
AE HOLOGRAPHICS INC (HOLO-Non-standard)
GA 1997212199
AB       The discharge device includes an insulator formed of hard heat-resistant material, two electrodes, and a conductor for coupling the two electrodes across terminals. One of the electrodes is annular shaped. The insulator has a small-diameter axial bore with two ends formed in it, one end being open and having the annular-shaped electrode surrounding and positioned at it.
   The second electrode is disposed in a position to close the second end of the bore. The terminals are of a source voltage which is adapted to be rapidly charged and discharged. An ionized path is periodically formed in the bore between the two electrodes, the path resulting in the rapid electrical discharge of the source of voltage and the production of the unidirectional high-energy acoustic wave from the open end of the bore.
   USE/ADVANTAGE -   For non-destructive inspection for fault in or beneath surface of structure, e.g. debonds or delaminations in composite materials, cracks, broken stringers, delaminations and in semi-monocoque structures; inspection of composite material used in control surface of drone, target and missile as well as vertical stabiliser, aileron and wing control element on military and commercial aircraft; fuselage structure. Can be used both in-plant and in-field. Simulates "tapping" of surface of object.

AB       The missile has at least one warhead (14) and an associated device (16) to eject it above the missile height, in order to allow sufficient time for it to become aerodynamically stable and to acquire a target. Stabilising equipment is arranged between the device and the warhead.
   The equipment has a stabilising parachute (28) and a rotating parachute (30), and the device is separated from the warhead by a first separating equipment which is arranged between it and the stabilising parachute. A second separating equipment may also be arranged between the parachutes, and one or both separations may be controlled by a timer.
   ADVANTAGE -   Allows the warhead to be released from a low flying unmanned aerial vehicle, with sufficient time for it to acquire its target without compromising the position of the vehicle.

AB       The method involves using drones (2) which follow curved trajectories around a central reference point (1). At the reference point there is a radio control transmitter tuned to a particular adjustable frequency which represents a reference radius of curvature for the trajectory. The radius increases and decreases with the transmitted frequency.
   Each drone is equipped with a radio receiver tuned to the transmission frequency of the radio control. Each drone is also equipped with a proximity sensor which acts on a weighting circuit in order to adjust the trajectory to maintain a suitable spacing between the drones.
   USE/ADVANTAGE -   For e.g antimissile and anti-aircraft alarm system used with slowly moving object such as ship. Provides simple control to avoid collision between drones and maintain constant separation distances.

AB       Thermosetting reactive compsn., based on natural and/or synthetic elastomers (I) contg. olefinic double bonds and vulcanising agents (II), has a max. loss factor (DINB 53440) of at least 0.1, pref. 0.2 or more at 200 Hz in the range from +10 to +40 C in the vulcanised state. Also claimed is a method of preparing the compsn. by mixing the components, using high shear. Also claimed are methods in which the compsn. is used for (a) bonding metal parts and/or sealing joints between these; (b) coating substrates by spraying or extrusion; and (c) coating, bonding and/or sealing substrate with an extruded film, cord or band of the compsn., followed by thermal cure in each case.
   USE -   The compsn. is used as acoustic damping one- or two-component adhesive, sealant and/or coating compsn.. It is esp. useful on thin sheet metal used in the mfr. of vehicles, machinery and equipment.
   ADVANTAGE -   Good acoustic attenuation is achieved and the drone of sheet metal constructions is reduced without adding 3,4-polyisoprene, which is difficult to obtain. The compsn. also has the required strength (shear strength and adhesion) at break, flexibility and resistance to ageing and abrasion; and is easy to handle.

GA 1995054284
AB       The drone (2) moves around a central point (1) to which the cable (3) is attached. The motor (6) is a propeller or a turbine and the flight is controlled by devices such as an aileron (5) or stabiliser (9). A wing-shaped carrier (4) supports radar and optical sensors (8) e.g. a TV camera or an infrared sensor.
   The radar may be active using emission and reception signals transmitted through the cable. It may be a passive deflector reflecting waves from a ground-based transceiver. The antenna may be within the cable or a V-shaped formed by two drones. The drone orientation may be changed by altering the cable fixing point.
   USE/ADVANTAGE -   Battlefield surveillance, site protection. Improved detection accuracy.

GA 1994342280
AB       Sugar soln. feeding system for bumble-bees or drones comprises a polythene bag or container with round fill opening and a hard polyethylene upstanding on the upper side. This upstand is in the form of a cylindrical tube or cup and contains a plug of highly absorbent material which extends down through the tubular opening into the container filled with sugar soln.. The plug completely fills the neck of the tubular opening and remains satd. with sugar soln. on its upper surface, whilst sugar soln. is still present within the container.
   USE -   Used for feeding bumble-bees or drones in beehives placed in greenhouses where they are used to naturally pollinate the products grown, e.g. tomatoes, peppers.
   ADVANTAGE -   The sugar dispensing system is contained within the hive and does not require replenishment during the life of the bumble-bees or drones, thus eliminating the time previously required for this activity. The sugar soln. is no longer accessible to e.g. wasps and honey-bees from outside.

AB       In the guidance system, an optical fibre (14) or bundle of wires is used to link a wire guided missile (12) to its firing base (10), allowing the missile to be guided over large distances. In order to reduce the mechanical strain on the optical fibre or wire, an additional aircraft or drone (18) is also attached to the fibre, between the missile and its base. The drone is intended to be recoverable.
   Inside the drone, two sections of optical fibre (14a,14b) may be joined together, with a signal regenerator enhancing the signals for onward transmission.
   ADVANTAGE -   Base station may retain control of missile and receive real time video pictures during flight.

GA 1994176446
AB       The multiple radar interference suppressor has a number of sources of radar transmit signals of approximately the same frequency, and coupled to a receiver. A device phase locks a pulse repetition frequency of the received radar transmit signals of a first source to a second source. An offset device phase offsets the pulse repetition frequency of the locked, received radar transmit signals of the two sources, and is coupled between the device for receiving and the device for phase locking.
   The device for pseudo-randomly encoding the radar transmit signals of each source is encoding coupled to the device for phase locking. A transmitter supplies the pseudo-randomly encoded signals, and is coupled to the pseudo-randomly encoder.
   USE/ADVANTAGE -   For eliminating scattered or reflected signals from missiles or other drones having similar pulse repetition frequency (PRF).

GA 1994133069
AB       The air cushion consists of a housing with a flight hole in its front wall and a heater. The heater is in the form of a mesh chamber containing an electric light bulb, and the air cushion has a double bottom, one side of which is smooth and has a port covered by a ventilation mesh, while the other has lengthwise bars attached to it to form troughs for feed or for collecting pollen and compartments which are covered by mesh on the inside and are open on the outside.
   The housing is divided into three sections - an upper one with guides and an aperture in its rear wall for a double bottom, and with the mesh chamber for the latter in the lower section.
   The lengthwise bars have grooves to receive a mesh which is used when the bees are receiving treatment.
   ADVANTAGE -   Improved conditions for rearing bees, producing the maximum number of workers and reducing the drone population. Bul. 5/7.2.93

GA 1993287374
AB       The Drone Control System is comprised of a ground station and an air vehicle. The air vehicle in the Drone Control System is an operable aircraft. The ground station includes a replicated cockpit of the operable aircraft with the identical controls as are found on the operable aircraft. Control movements at the ground station by the operator are translated from analog displacements to digital signals and telemetered to the drone aircraft.
   Digital telemetry signals are then used by simple mechanical actuators in the controls to exactly replicate the original control movement in the ground station. Drone aircraft response in the handling quantities are therefore exactly like those of the aircraft before droning, the only difference is the replacement of the pilot with a set of mechanical actuators. Attitude and performance information of the aircraft, or air vehicle, will be telemetered using a video link, rather than telemetered readings from the instrument themselves.
   USE/ADVANTAGE -   Provides a Drone Control System designed to remotely fly an aircraft originally designed to be flown with a pilot on board. The pilot is replaced with a set of mechanical actuators in the aircraft which are controlled from a ground station. Transferrable to multiple platforms, requires no permanent modifications to existing aircraft.

AB       The drone carries a recovery hook held on an extending support above the rear the of the aircraft. The catch-line (3) is slung between the open ends of a recovery frame which is held into the flight path of the drone. The recovery line is attached to brake lines to retard the drone and recover it.
   The frame is primed and held for recovery, e.g. over the side of a ship. The braking path is controlled under a longitudinal boom behind the frame, which then supports the recovered drone held by the catch line. The recovery system can have a sensor to monitor the position of the incoming drone.
