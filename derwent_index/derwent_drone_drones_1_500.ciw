AB    NOVELTY - The accelerometer has a proof mass assembly (1) comprising one or more hoop flexures (6) flexibly connecting an inner hoop (8) to an outer hoop (2). A center pad flexure (10) comprises a center raised pad (18) at its distal end, for flexibly connecting the center raised pad to the inner hoop. Two or more proof mass flexures (14A,14B) flexibly connect the proof mass (12) to the inner hoop and allow the proof mass to move out of a plane defined by the inner hoop. A dimension and a placement of each pad flexure maintain resonant modes of the proof mass assembly above 2kHz.
   USE - Accelerometer for navigation system and positioning system used in aircraft, autonomous vehicle e.g. drone, satellite, missile, or other precision-guided systems, for performing operations such as location determination, navigation, altitude determination, heading determination, active control of flight surfaces, and autopilot functions.
   ADVANTAGE - The bias and bias instabilities in accelerometers are reduced. The errors in the model due to thermal effects are reduced. The hysteresis which can be one component of the thermal model error is reduced. The new bias error is reduced by preventing or minimizing the changes in the electrical null position and the mechanical null position of the proof mass. The forces and/or strain placed on the accelerometer during construction and during use that can result in non-acceleration-dependent changes to the proof mass position and the capacitive gaps, are prevented or minimized in order to reduce the thermal model error, so as to enable the electronics to better determine the acceleration of proof mass assembly. Center raised pad and the accelerometer supports prevent the non-moving sections from altering the capacitive gaps between the non-moving sections and the capacitive plates of proof mass, so as to provide a more accurate capacitive gap, and a better determination of the actual acceleration. A more accurate accelerometer is realized with a smaller profile and with reduced costs as the need for preventing forces and/or strains from construction and other materials is significantly diminished.

AB    NOVELTY - The shifter (300) has a first electrode connected to an input port. A second electrode is connected to an output port and arranged parallel to the first electrode. A substrate is placed between the first electrode and the second electrode. First and second digitally adjustable variable capacitors are placed on the first and second electrodes, where adjustment of the variable capacitors causes phase shift between the input port and the output port. First and second inductors are arranged on the first and second electrodes in parallel with the first and second variable capacitors.
   USE - Interdigital capacitor low loss and high resolution phase shifter for use in a base station, a phased array antenna system of an air and space-borne communication system and a radar system, a high altitude platform (HAP) e.g. airplane, airship, helicopter, gyrocopter, blimp, multi-copter, glider, balloon, fixed wing and rotary wing, vehicle e.g. aerial platform such as drone, terrestrial platform such as car, lorry and train, and an aquatic platform such as boat, and a mount. Can also be used in a phase discriminator, beam forming network, power divider, power amplifier and an electronically steered antenna.
   ADVANTAGE - The shifter adjusts phase of individual elements to shape an area of coverage, thus resulting in longer transmissions or steering transmission direction without physically moving an array. The shifter allows a combination of the inductor and the variable capacitor to increase a dynamic range without increasing total capacity reducing total insertion losses. The variable capacitors allow an individual variable capacitor to remain small, thus providing better resolution, while allowing sufficient total capacitance to provide degrees of phase shift.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included for the following:
   (1) a system for operating an interdigital capacitor low loss and high resolution phase shifter
   (2) a method for operating an interdigital capacitor low loss and high resolution phase shifter.

AB    NOVELTY - The system has a master control unit (100) to obtain global positioning system (GPS) coordinates, orientation and motion information with respect to replica firearm (101) from firearm GPS unit, orientation and motion sensors. The actuation of trigger of replica firearm is detected. A trajectory of a theoretical shot fired by replica firearm at trigger actuation is determined whether it intercepts drone as it flies along predetermined flight path based on GPS coordinates of drone and GPS coordinates, orientation and motion information with respect to replica firearm as aimed by a user.
   USE - Target-shooting simulation system for simulating hunting of target e.g. duck or other live-fowl hunting target such as quail, pheasant, goose, bounding deer, rabbit and squirrel.
   ADVANTAGE - The full realism with the look, feel and apparent action of a real firearm without the danger and cost of live ammunition/target destruction is achieved. The scenario playback which may be viewed as a dynamic scorecard in which the gunshot trajectory and flying target are animated to depict their relative locations in time/space, may similarly be rendered on a user-interface of the master control unit, thus enabling the user to perceive nuances in projectile dispersion in relation to the moving drone target. The derivatives of the positional data are calculated to obtain gun barrel velocity, acceleration, jerk, as desirable to accurately calculate the trajectory of a physical gunshot. A post-shooting-session scorecard, including animated playback, is rendered on a user-interface of the master controller, ancillary device or other computing device to enable an individual user to assess shooting results and/or promote competition between multiple shooters.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for a method of operation within a target-shooting simulation system for simulating hunting.

AB    NOVELTY - The method involves determining which occluded points (2020) can be removed by using an accelerated approach of close sister points (2011c) and looking out from an assumed non-occluded point (2010). A closest point is found in the next set of points looking back into the first set of points if not occluded and jumping to the closest not occluded point and looking back if occluded. A second sister is confirmed as a close sister only if the second sister is close to the assumed non-occluded point. A faster computation of differences is dramatically enabled.
   USE - Method for control of robotic devices and data acquisition e.g. radio-controlled vehicles, surveillance drones and similar devices.
   ADVANTAGE - The interactions between the sparse point cloud model and a vectorized object model for better manipulation and editing are enabled. The accurate data association for a multiple data collection device platform despite optional conveyance of the platform is performed. The noise of the data in the sparse point cloud model and the size of the data are reduced.

AB    NOVELTY - The method (1500) involves obtaining a first frame of a scene. The recognition of the object is performed (1504) within a first bounding region of the first frame. The tracking of the object within the first bounding region of the first frame is performed (1512). A second bounding region of a second frame is determined based on tracked object, where second frame is subsequent to the first frame. A determination is made whether second bounding region is valid or not based on predetermined object model.
   USE - Method for tracking and detecting target object performed by electronic device (claimed). Uses include but are not limited to cameras, video camcorders, digital cameras, cellular phones, smart phones, computers, TV, automobiles, personal cameras, action cameras, surveillance cameras, mounted cameras, connected cameras, robots, drones, smart applications, healthcare equipment, set-top boxes, etc.
   ADVANTAGE - The method is capable of improving the accuracy of object tracking and speed of the tracking and detection algorithms. The color correction, color adjustment, white balance, contrast enhancement, de-hazing, red eye removal, sharpness adjustment, noise reduction, lens correction, filtering, image merging, object highlighting or image distortion are enabled efficiently. The boundary region of interest around the object is maintained while preventing the region of interest from expanding unnecessarily or losing track of the object. Since motion-based tracking is less computationally intensive than object detection, an electronic device skips performing object detection where motion-based tracking is used to accurately track a target object within a current video frame.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are included for the following:
   (1) an electronic device;
   (2) a computer-program product comprising a non-transitory tangible computer-readable medium storing instructions for tracking and detecting target object; and
   (3) an apparatus for tracking and detecting target object.

AB    NOVELTY - The vehicle has processors to temporally and spatially align sensor data (112,114,116) received from a two-dimensional sensor (102), a three-dimensional sensor (104), and one or more motion, location, and orientation sensors (106). A map representation (128) of a real world environment is generated in a frame of reference of the vehicle based on the aligned sensor data. Multiple visual features in the map representation are recognized using one or more computer vision algorithms. One or more of the visual features are annotated in accordance with domain-specific business logic.
   USE - Navigation-capable vehicle such as mobile robot, unmanned or unpiloted ground and/or aerial vehicle e.g. drone and driverless vehicle, motorized vehicle, etc.
   ADVANTAGE - The processes performed by the data capture and synchronization module helps ensure low-latency of the pipeline, such that the delivery of geospatial analytics and mapping data occurs in real time, or at least in interactive time. The compression subsystem enables efficient compression and robust transmission of the data between the air/ground mobile computing platform and other devices. The resulting data compression helps ensure real-time delivery of data and analytics results to requesting users and/or services. The real-time visualization of the data collection on the platform allows a platform operator or other user to quickly verify the quality and coverage of the sensor data and then re-collect data if necessary. The platform provides remote platform operators with an improved ability to navigate and explore environments, which is superior to that which can be achieved by the limited camera systems currently in use. The feature computation module can work directly with point cloud data without the need for polygonal models of objects of interest, enabling easy extension of the set of targeted features without expensive modeling and learning. The precision alignment of two-dimensional and three-dimensional shapes for verification of features can be achieved for ensuring high accuracy and low false alarms.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are included for the following:

A receptacle (100) is attached to portions of support structure proximate the port, such that the receptacle routes a portion of a load borne by the support structure around the break defined by the port. A removable payload assembly is mounted within the receptacle opening. A pressure ring forms a seal between an inner surface (103) of the receptacle and an outer surface of payload assembly.
   USE - Aircraft e.g. fixed wing small business jet aircraft, propeller driven aircraft, rotorcraft, lighter-than-air aircraft including dirigible, or any type of remotely piloted or drone aircraft.
   ADVANTAGE - By coupling the receptacle to the support structure, and/or forming the receptacle housing unitarily, a larger portion of the support structure proximate the port is removed to accommodate a larger payload assembly without reducing the structural integrity of the aircraft. The receptacle flanges and/or the payload assembly flanges are configured to prevent or inhibit incorrect installation of the payload assembly within the receptacle. The pressure ring is configured to form a seal adjacent the gaps between the inner surface of the receptacle and the outer surface of payload assembly, and thus, enabling the interior of the aircraft proximate port to maintain pressurization relative to the external environment. The pins inserted through the openings in the payload assembly prevent the installation tool from falling during the installation. The installer is allowed to secure the payload assembly flanges and/or the pressure ring to the receptacle using fasteners while the installation tool is self-supporting. Installation of the window assembly is facilitated, as the flanges of the window assembly and the receptacle flanges are within a single plane, and thus, facilitating alignment of the flanges of the window assembly with the receptacle flanges. The handles facilitate installation and/or removal of the plug in the receptacle without the use of the installation tool. More efficient installation, removal, and/or replacement of payload assembly within aircraft are enabled.

AB    NOVELTY - The method involves controlling (1006) a micromirror in a first subset to move from a primary position of the micromirror to a first tilt position of the micromirror to reflect an energy from a first region of interest (ROI) toward a second sensor. The first sensor generates the new sensor data during frame period of the frame periods. The micromirror in the first subset is controlled to move from the primary position of the micromirror to the first tilt position of the micromirror to reflect the energy toward the second sensor during the wait period of a first frame period.
   USE - Method for causing energy associated with region of interest to be reflected to sensor in aircraft, ground vehicle, drone, unmanned aerial vehicle.
   ADVANTAGE - The energy of the first ROI is reflected toward the second sensor without affecting the resolution, frame rate operation of the first sensor, or otherwise interrupt the generation of a real-time FOV full motion video by the first sensor. The columns operate as slits often used in a spectrograph to introduce selected energy to the spectrograph while eliminating unwanted energy. The spatial isolation reduces full image hyper-cube processing burdens.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a system for directing spatially isolated energy to sensor for analysis.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a flow chart illustrating a process for causing energy associated with a region of interest (ROI) to be reflected to a sensor.

AE HALLIBURTON ENERGY SERVICES INC (HALL-C)
GA 2017124977
AB    NOVELTY - The calibration method involves obtaining the reference spectral of the optical filters (404A-404C) having different transmission levels. Each reference spectrum has defined spectral patterns that simulate spectral data of a sample (406). The reference spectra are then used to calibrate an optical computing device (400).
   USE - Calibration method of optical computing devices (claimed) using traceable optical filters. Can be used for optical computing devices used in downhole well or completion applications, undersea monitoring, satellite or drone surveillance, pipeline monitoring, and sensors transiting a body cavity such as a digestive tract.
   ADVANTAGE - Provides a more economically efficient calibration model that allows the spectral output of an optical computing device to be calibrated to correct for the difference between real optical detector response outputs and simulated optical detector response outputs. Ensures that the calibration process can be performed anytime in the future to re-standardize the computing device in case of thermal drift, since the traceable optical filters may be built-in into the optical sensor. Uses a set of built-in traceable optical filter standards that allow the calibration process to be conducted safely anywhere and anytime with minimal operational cost. Performs calibration that is more accurate and precise than using fluid samples due to the high stability and reproducibility of the traceable optical filters. Ensures that the optical computing device can be calibrated downhole prior to measuring the real downhole sampling fluids because the traceable filter disc can be built into the optical computing device configuration. Ensures that optical computing device can be calibrated before measuring each sample to reduce the risk of thermal drift because the calibration process can be conducted easily. Eliminates the potential disparity between sensor and tool since calibration can be done into the tool directly. Uses a detector calibration approach that allows the calibration to be built based on simulated spectral data of real fluids instead of developing a calibration model based on real sample spectral data of each individual detector.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for the optical computing device.

AB    NOVELTY - The handle has an outer shell (8) formed by joining two rigid half-shells (10, 12). A sealing element (14) comprises a twist joint that continuously extends along a three-dimensional path between joint faces (20, 21) on a level of a joint zone. An annular joint completely turns around a function block (6) and is located at a level of another joint zone, where a cross-section of the annular joint is different from a cross section of the twist joint. An integral block of the sealing element is made of an elastomer material and joins the annular and twist joints.
   USE - Sealed control handle for use in a control panel of a machine (all claimed) such as aircraft i.e. helicopter. Can also be used for an airplane, a glider, an unmanned aerial vehicle i.e. drone, a building site vehicle, an earthwork vehicle, a boat, a handling machine, a wheel chair and a crane.
   ADVANTAGE - The integral block of the sealing element is made of the elastomer material and joins the annular and twist joints, thus ensuring better water-tightness in the handle to avoid penetration of water into an interior part of the handle, and hence avoiding damage of operation of the function block. The annular joint is oriented perpendicular at an end of the twist joint without requiring external pressure, thus facilitating assembly of the sealing element during assembly of the handle.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The annular joint is designed as an O-ring, a flat joint or bellows joint.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a schematic exploded view of a sealed control handle of a control panel.

AB    NOVELTY - The method involves continuously scanning remote control signals on a detection antenna array (101) to detect a drone (150) and a drone control signal (151). Source direction of the drone is determined on the detection antenna array. An override signal is created on a neutralization system (110) based on detected drone control signal. The override signal is transmitted from a transmission antenna (115) connected to the neutralization system towards direction of the drone. A video link associated with the detected drone is scanned. A video feed is recorded based on detection of the video link.
   USE - Method for detecting and defeating a drone e.g. non-military drone and military drone, for crop dusting applications, high wire inspection applications, weather monitoring applications, firefighting applications, search and rescue mission applications, food and commodity delivery system applications, border security applications, disaster response applications, ground surveillance mechanism for law enforcement authorities applications, checkpoint operations in border patrols applications and crime prevention applications in urban areas.
   ADVANTAGE - The method enables detecting and defeating the drone system that thwarts and captures the drones in a way that is non-offensive, non-combative, and non-destructive. The method enables transmitting signal back enabling the system to receive and process the signal when the detection antenna array detects the drone control signal, thus identifying bearing of the drone, the drone control signal and source relative to the position of the detection antenna array with greater accuracy and reliability. The method enables an amplifier to improve overall drone control distance and contribute towards robust signal stability. The method enables visual of the detected drone through a mounted infrared camera to supplement the system to ascertain the make and model of the detected drone, thus enabling the system to speed up the process of detection by transmitting the overriding signal without any further ado. The method enables a magnetron source to offer high energy conversion efficiency and to reduce risk of interference by shifting magnetron source's resonant frequency in a more desirable frequency spectrum conducive to conditions for drone control.

AB    NOVELTY - The method involves aligning ad hoc nodes (105-1-105-5) of an array (100) in time and frequency. Relative location i.e. geolocation, of each node of the array is obtained for obtaining relative layout of the array. An environment of the array is characterized by identifying clutter objects by employing radio frequency iterative time reversal (RF-ITR) with singular value decomposition (SVD) and successive clutter object cancellation. First target is searched using the RF-ITR and clutter cancellation. Second target is searched using the RF-ITR, the clutter and first target cancellations.
   USE - Method for sensing targets such as objects, drone and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), behind opaque obstacles such as walls and doors, in line-of-sight (LOS) environments and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) environments, to monitor the UAV and occupant motion by home automation systems for enabling energy conservation measures and/or home security measures for military and commercial applications. Can also be used for aircrafts, water vessels, buoys, land vehicles and satellites.
   ADVANTAGE - The method enables utilizing massively-distributed architecture, so that emissions from each node are individually weak, thus spreading resources across wide area, and hence minimizing risk of total system loss from anti-radiation missiles. If a structure of opportunity such as a hillside is available, The method enables throwing down a series of nodes to create a massive aperture for a detection range of less than 15 kilometer without need for roads or trails, thus avoiding use of a brute-force focused-beam raster scan, which can be required to achieve sufficient power on target for adequate detection signal-to-noise ratio, and hence cutting maximum search time from tens of seconds for a truck mounted radar to hundreds of milliseconds. The method enables quickly beamforming an electromagnetic signal based on processing space, time, and frequency data embedded in backscattered/reflected radiation.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for an array of ad hoc radio frequency nodes.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a schematic view of nodes of an array of Radio Frequency nodes configured with features.

A sensor (150) detects rotation of the safety rotor. A controller (160) determines deceleration of the safety rotor corresponding to one of the safety units contacting the object using the sensor. The controller causes rotation of the flight rotor to cease in response to detecting deceleration of the safety rotor.
   USE - Safety rotor system for an aircraft e.g. rotary-wing aircraft such as helicopters, radio-controlled aircraft and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) such as drones, for civil and military applications.
   ADVANTAGE - The system ensures that contact between the safety units and an object is to be significantly less damaging than contact between the flight rotor and the object. The system facilitates lightweight designs compared with rigid safety unit and allows for resilient safety unit, which can elastically deform with minimal transfer of energy to the object in event of collision. The system disables respective flight rotor to prevent damaging contact with the respective flight rotor and three remaining flight rotors to remain active and controlled to cause the aircraft to maneuver away from the safety rotor that came into contact with the object to prevent contact when the object is encountered by one of the safety rotors.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The sensor includes an optical sensor, an electromagnetic sensor, a capacitive sensor and a strain sensor.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a side view of a safety rotor system for an aircraft.

AB    NOVELTY - The vehicle (10) has a flow restrictor comprising third cross-sectional area of set of cross sectional areas that is smaller than the first cross-sectional area and movable between a stowed position and a fully deployed position. A consistent gap is formed between a periphery of the flow restrictor and an inner surface of a cowling with the flow restrictor in the fully deployed position, where difference between the first cross-sectional area of the cowling and the third cross-sectional area of the flow restrictor is approximately equal to the second cross-sectional area of a throat.
   USE - Hypersonic vehicle for traveling at hypersonic speeds using air-breathing hypersonic engine e.g. scramjet engine and turbojet or turbofan engine. Uses include but are not limited to an aircraft, a missile, a space plane, an airplane and a drone.
   ADVANTAGE - The vehicle prevents or mitigates an inlet buzz, unstarts and enables a use of an optimized, high inlet internal contraction ratio and highly curved inlets. The vehicle reduces an amount of inlet air flow that is ingested by the inlet at subsonic and supersonic speeds that allows the inlet air to avoid contraction or to be minimally contracted in the inlet without becoming sonic at an inlet throat which is called choking, thus allowing the air flow to pass through the inlet at supersonic or hypersonic speeds, and preventing inlet unstart and buzz. The vehicle facilitates smooth deflection of the air flow outside of inlet by the flow restrictor to prevent a buildup of a strong shock wave in front of inlet, thus preventing inlet buzz and unstart conditions with the flow restrictor in the fully deployed position and the air flow at speeds below where the inlet can start.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a method for preventing inlet buzz and unstart conditions in a hypersonic air-breathing engine.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a bottom perspective view of a hypersonic vehicle with an inlet flow restrictor.

AE ACCELERATED TECHNOLOGIES AG LLC (ACCE-Non-standard)
GA 201700064S
AB    NOVELTY - Method (M1) of producing grain, comprises: (a) growing a designated female plant comprising both female and male components; (b) intentionally cross-pollinating the designated female plant with designated male plant pollen from a different genetic background on at least one occasions; (c) growing the designated female plant to maturity; and (d) harvesting the grain produced by the designated female plant.
   USE - The methods are useful for: producing grain; maximizing synchronous pollinations in grain production; and modifying both grain yield and grain characteristics by modifying pollination in grain production (all claimed), where the characteristics are increased oil production, decreased oil production, increased starch production, decreased starch production, improved drought resistance, improved resistance to flooding or other sources of excessive moisture, improved performance in high heat conditions, improved performance in low heat conditions, improved fungal resistance, improved insect resistance, increased yield, and improved pollination. The improved yield of the grain was tested in maize plant obtained by cross pollinating hybrid and pollen donor inbred. The result showed that the maize plant obtained by cross pollinating female hybrid (H1) and pollen donor inbred (P1) exhibited 8.7% increase in grain yield due to cross pollination.
   ADVANTAGE - The methods: provide increased grain yield with modified grain characteristics comprising at least one of grain size, grain content, or grain composition; increase grain purity (claimed) and heterosis; permit real-time agronomic decision making in order to maximize grain yield by overcoming biotic and abiotic challenges; enable effective grain production without solely relying upon self-pollination or pollination by neighboring plants; and avoid cross-pollination by enhancing self-pollination, thus ensuring lower levels of cross contamination from undesirable pollen.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included for:
   (1) a method (M2) of maximizing synchronous pollinations in grain production, comprising step (a) as above per se, intentionally pollinating the designated female plant with self- or sib-pollen on the occasions, and steps (c) and (d) as above per se; and
   (2) a method (M3) of modifying both grain yield and grain characteristics by modifying pollination in grain production, comprising step (a) as above per se, intentionally pollinating the designated female plant with designated male plant pollen on the occasions, and steps (c) and (d) as above per se.
TF TECHNOLOGY FOCUS - BIOLOGY - Preferred Method: The intentional application of designated male plant pollen is conducted by at least one of mechanical means, pneumatic means, positive pressure means, negative pressure means, and/or manual means, preferably automated or semi-automated means. The designated male plant pollen is: applied on more than one occasion to the same designated female plant; and applied at the time which the female plant first becomes receptive to the pollen. The maturity of the male components of the designated female plant is delayed with a treatment. The designated male plant pollen is obtained from: sources optimal for application based on environmental conditions, where the environmental conditions are abiotic conditions comprising at least one of drought, humidity, temperature, nitrogen availability or nutrient availability, or biotic conditions comprising at least one of insect pest pressure or disease pressure; sources optimal for application based on plant performance data; sources optimal for application based on market and commodity price information; a single genetic source; or multiple genetic sources and is combined before application. Preferred Components: The designated male plant pollen comprises at least one of fresh pollen and preserved pollen. The designated female plant is at least one of a maize plant, a soybean plant, a wheat plant, a rice plant, a sunflower plant, a canola plant, a Sorghum plant, a barley plant, or a pearl millet plant. The automated or semi-automated means is an autonomous or semi-autonomous vehicle or drone. The designated male plant pollen is: fresh pollen which has been harvested from at least one of a field, a growth chamber, a greenhouse, a glasshouse, a shade house, a hoop house, a vertical farming facility or a hydroponic facility; or preserved pollen which has been previously collected and has been preserved by chilling, cooling, cryopreservation, freezing, freeze drying, or storage in liquid nitrogen. The source of fresh or preserved pollen has been collected from at least one of: a growth chamber with altered circadian rhythm; a source with normal circadian flowering, but where the male components of the designated female parent plants are delayed; and a source with normal circadian flowering where the male components of the designated female parent plants are allowed to shed with no delay. The designated male plant pollen influences the characteristics of the grain harvested from the female plant, where the influence impacts at least one of grain oil content, grain starch content, grain protein content, grain oil composition, grain starch composition, and grain protein composition.
   ACTIVITY - Plant Protectant.
   MECHANISM OF ACTION - Gene therapy.
   EXAMPLE - Pollen from the earliest shedding field was collected and preserved/stored until the second unrelated hybrid field begins to flower, and then pollen from the first hybrid field was applied at an early morning hour to enhance cross pollination and minimize self-pollination in the second hybrid field. The application was conducted for 2-3 days in a row during the heaviest flowering days. The process was repeated by collecting, preserving, and storing the pollen from the second field and applying it to a third unrelated hybrid field when it begins to flower, and so on to a large number of fields until the flowering season ends. In this way, a significant portion of the maize grain in a region was the result of cross pollination rather than self-pollination, resulting in a yield increase in these fields of 5-10%.
