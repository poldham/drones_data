AB    NOVELTY - The system has a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera that passes information to a Pos-Neg identifier, and a bucket photodetector that passes information to another Pos-Neg identifier. The Pos-Neg identifiers pass information to a positive-negative fluctuation circuit (PNFC) comprising a processor and a memory operatively associated with the processor, where the memory contains a positive-negative fluctuation protocol algorithm. The PNFC detects photon coincidence from intensity fluctuation correlation of sunlight, and passes resulting correlation information to an image viewer.
   USE - Turbulence free CCD camera system for producing an image e.g. digital image and film image, and video of an object e.g. area, scene and landscape, in an aerial vehicle e.g. satellite, airplane, helicopter and drone (all claimed).
   ADVANTAGE - The bucket photodetector and a positive-negative fluctuation protocol make a turbulence-free image of a target of micrometer imaging resolution to be observed based on intensity fluctuation correlation measurement. The classic camera and a proposed turbulence-free camera system comprise adequate spatial resolution to zoom long distance and distinguish the objects within a small area, even with a small lens.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a method for using a camera system.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a schematic block diagram of an experimental setup for studying intensity-fluctuation and order spatial correlation and anti-correlation by scanning point-like photodetector transversely.

GA 2014V13796
AB    NOVELTY - The watercraft (500) has a pump jet disposed within the passageway of an elongate hull (505) to receive and pump water so as to propel the hull through the water. Nozzles (545) disposed on the outer surface of the hull release friction-reducing fluid that displaces water from the outer surface of the hull so as to diminish friction on the outer surface and facilitate high speeds.
   USE - Watercraft e.g. for military applications. Uses include but are not limited to a surface craft, a submarine, and a torpedo (all claimed), an unmanned drone, and a high speed attack and reconnaissance craft, and also used for non-military and civilian applications e.g. security applications such as police, immigration and drug enforcement, public safety applications such as sea rescues, high speed servicing and re-supply applications such as servicing oil drilling platforms, high-speed water taxi applications, and private pleasure craft applications.
   ADVANTAGE - The watercraft such as attack craft is small, fast, highly maneuverable, and heavily-armed, and provides a stable platform even when running at high speeds in ocean swells so as to minimize physical stress on crew and provide a stable weapon platform. The watercraft also remains on station for substantial period of time to maintain reliable defensive perimeter at safe distance from a naval battle group, and provide effective defense against small boat swarm. Since the watercraft establishes the defensive perimeter at safe distance, interception, identification, warning and, if necessary, destruction of hostile boats can be performed even before approaching the battle group. The watercraft is also capable of stealth mode operation by employing small radar, infrared, visual and noise signatures, making the watercraft difficult to detect and target, and also allowing the watercraft to effectively conduct reconnaissance and deliver or extract small teams of special forces behind enemy lines. The watercraft is capable of moving through the water at high speeds by dispersing friction-reducing fluid on the hull outer surface.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a method for moving through water.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows the schematic side view of a watercraft in form of a submarine.

AB    NOVELTY - The gun (300) has a piston provided with an outer end to provide a gas valve with an airtight seal in a closed state, and a control reservoir formed within a piston receptacle between an inner end of the piston and inner walls of the receptacle. A trigger unit releases control chamber gas from the reservoir to cause the piston to slide away from a gas outlet to an open state, where the piston releases sufficient amount of high pressure gas from a gas reservoir body into a breech end of a barrel to drive a projectile.
   USE - Quick-release valve air gun for shooting projectiles e.g. nets, ropes, bolas and chains, to disable a target e.g. person, animal, vehicle and boat. Can also be used for launching a robot, drone and an unmanned aerial vehicle, spreading fertilizer, an animal feed, a seed grain, a pesticide and launching a tee-shirt, a hot dog, a prize, a literature and a flyer.
   ADVANTAGE - The gun comprises a trigger mechanism, which releases the control chamber gas from the control reservoir, so that pressure in the control reservoir is reduced, and the piston is caused to slide away from an inner edge of the gas outlet, thus opening the gas valve and firing the projectile from the gun. The gas valve is in gaseous communication with the barrel, thus enhancing force for driving the projectile down the barrel with projectile muzzle velocity in an effective manner. The gun comprises a projectile holding part that fits relatively tightly within a slotted hole when the gun is fired, thus avoiding binding up when the projectiles are shifted into a firing position within the gun, and hence minimizing gas leakage.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a method for configuring a quick-release valve air gun to shoot a projectile.

AB    NOVELTY - Invention relates to submarines and jet projectiles launched therefrom. Proposed method comprises opening the cover of submarine deep-water container at surface position and loading of drone therein. Said cover is sealed and submarine dives to launch area and to launch depth. Container cover is opened to start the drone jet engine. Prior to submarine container cover sealing, drone surfacing means is arranged inside container, at its top section. Said means is connected with said drone by flexible linkage including compressed resilient bag and system to inflate it with compressed gas by over pressure. Resilient bag volume is selected to ensure positive buoyancy of drone surface means. Prior to drone engine starting, said resilient bag is supercharged by supercharging system. Jet engine starting and flexible linkage unlocking are executed after drone surfacing from container and submarine exiting from launch site.
   USE - Transport.
   ADVANTAGE - Higher safety at drone launching.2 dwg

AB    NOVELTY - The MCN system has a second control and data component along with the second radio access component and processes the second wireless communications according to the first wireless standard. A second data store with authentication data of second user equipment is within the second covered area (312) such that the second MCN communication system independently provides the second MCN for the second user equipment and first MCN communication system and the second MCN communication system communicate with each other using the first wireless standard.
   USE - Mobile cellular network (MCN) system for providing independent mobile cellular network to devices within covered area is located on moving object such as airplane, drone, automobile, ship, boat and balloon, for providing communication pathways between client MCN communication systems and from one client MCN communication system to another MCN communication system such as another client MCN communication system, another host MCN communication system and standalone MCN communication system.
   ADVANTAGE - The session identifiers provide sufficient information to enable communications between a user equipment (UE) and the registered MCN regardless of the location of the UE. Once a UE has registered with a MCN communication system, the session identifiers provides information regarding the location of the UE such as the identity of the local MCN, such as when it is different from the registered MCN, how to access the UE such as routing information, and unique identifiers that enable the UE to communicate with the local MCN and the registered MCN. By registering the client and relay the MCN communication systems with the host MCN communication system as UEs, a UE moves from the covered area of a first MCN communication system to the covered area of a second MCN communication system without disrupting the service of the UE. The serving gateway (SGW) routes the user data from the UE to the packet data network gateway (PGW) or from the PGW to the UE, and provides support during inter-MCN communication system handovers.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a flow diagram illustrating the backhaul communications between various MCN communication systems.

AB    NOVELTY - The method involves ascertaining (712) a UFV (102) as a collision target (708) and executing (714) a maneuver (716) to divert the UFV towards the target to induce the collision to the target. A message indicating an identity of collision target is broadcast after executing the maneuver. A determination is made so as to whether the likelihood associated with the potential collision meets threshold likelihood limit so as to transmit the collision report prior to occurrence of the collision.
   USE - Method for hazard handling for unoccupied flying vehicle (UFV). Uses include but are not limited to unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), remotely piloted vehicle (RPV), unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV), unmanned aircraft (UA), drone, optionally-piloted vehicle (OPV), remotely piloted aircraft (RPA), remotely operated aircraft (ROA), radio-controlled aircraft, unmanned-aircraft vehicle system (UAVS), unmanned aircraft system and small unmanned air system (sUAS).
   ADVANTAGE - The target for collision can be selected easily based on risk of danger associated with potential collision targets so as to avoid an incendiary location, by execution of maneuver to induce the collision. The UFV can easily send a collision reporting authority without contemporaneous human instruction as a consequence of the collision's occurrence.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included for the following:

AB    NOVELTY - The method (800) involves obtaining a list of Wi-Fi networks associated with a user. An access request is received (805) to access particular Wi-Fi network from list of Wi-Fi networks. The determination (810) is made whether any of computing devices approve access request. The approval is obtained (840) from other computing device for accessing particular Wi-Fi network. A server computer is requested to verify whether one computing device is element of a trusted devices group. The particular Wi-Fi network is accessed using authentication profile obtained from other device.
   USE - Computer-implemented method for sharing authentication profile between portable mobile computing device such as mobile phone, smartphone and tablet computer, laptop computer and desktop computer for accessing Wi-Fi network. Can also be used in computing device such as automobile computer, game console, personal digital assistant, home appliance, TV, automobile, drone, airplane, autonomous device such as robot and other computing devices capable of running computer application such as mobile game, factory automation, banking, order-tracking and ticket purchase.
   ADVANTAGE - The ability of user to obtain authentication information required to gain access to the access restricted computing environment from another user device from which the user has accessed the access restricted computing environment previously is facilitated. The need for the user to input the authentication information again on the other user device is eliminated. As the authentication profile is obtained from one computing device, the need for a manual user input of the password to the wireless network is eliminated. Since the authentication module is configured to present notifications to the user to indicate the rejection of access requests received at other computing device from computing devices, the ability of user to manually approve or disapprove the access requests is improved.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are included for the following:
   (1) a computing device for obtaining access to particular Wi-Fi network; and
   (2) a server for facilitating sharing of authentication profile between multiple computing devices to access particular Wi-Fi network.

AB    NOVELTY - The method involves detecting motivation to activate an automated hazard handling routine of a first unoccupied flying vehicle (UFV) (102) by a machine by detecting a second UFV within a proximity zone of the first UFV, comparing a position of the first UFV with a position of the second UFV, receiving a proximity alert with respect to the second UFV at the first UFV and detecting physical contact with an object by using an accelerometer and a contact sensor. The automated hazard handling routine of the UFV is activated based on the motivation.
   USE - Method for handling hazard for an UFV for police or corporate purposes, military or governmental purposes and construction, agricultural, or warehouse site monitoring purposes. Uses include but are not limited to an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), a remotely piloted vehicle (RPV), an unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV), an unmanned aircraft (UA), a drone, an optionally-piloted vehicle (OPV), a remotely piloted aircraft (RPA), a remotely operated aircraft (ROA), a radio-controlled aircraft (R/C aircraft), an unmanned-aircraft vehicle system (UAVS), an unmanned aircraft system (UAS), and a small unmanned air system (sUAS).
   ADVANTAGE - The method enables the UAV to run diagnostic that determines high likelihood that a particular component of the UAV is not functioning within safe or accurate or recommended operating parameters or to realize that control circuitry is no longer receiving output or responses from a particular component. The method enables the machine to detect partial loss of functionality for a satellite positioning system (SPS) unit of the UFV. The method enables the UAV to analyze an electronic map to extract indicators of coordinates that indicate positions in space of a set of buildings, so that the UAV can plot a course safely through the set of buildings.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included for the following:
   (1) an UFV for hazard handling
   (2) a system for hazard handling for an UFV.

AB    NOVELTY - The refueling system (200) comprises a refueling hose (220) which is extendable from a tanker aircraft (100) in flight. A refueling drone (240) is coupled to a hose aft end (106) and is rearwardly deployable from tanker aircraft such that the refueling drone is towed by refueling hose behind tanker aircraft. The refueling drone is provided to engage a receiver aircraft (150) and transfer fuel from tanker aircraft to receiver aircraft. The refueling drone includes a refueling boom (260) which is outwardly pivotable from refueling drone.
   USE - Refueling system e.g aerial refueling system (claimed) used for refueling receiver aircraft, fixed-wing receiver aircraft and rotary-wing receiver aircraft for civil, commercial, and/or military purpose. Can also be used in automotive industry.
   ADVANTAGE - The refueling system is stored internally in the tanker aircraft. Thus the contributions to aerodynamic drag is minimized or eliminated, and the low-observable or stealth capability of the tanker aircraft is preserved. Since the wing pods of the tanker aircraft can be mounted proximate the wing tips of the tanker aircraft, the increased lateral spacing between simultaneously-refueled receiver aircraft is provided. Thus the risk of contact of the receiver aircraft is minimized. The maximized forward-aft spacing, minimizes the risk of physical contact between the tanker aircraft and the receiver aircraft when refueling in turbulent conditions.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a method for refueling an aircraft.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a perspective view of the tanker aircraft in the refueling operation with receiver aircraft by a refueling drone coupled to a refueling hose and towed behind the tanker aircraft.

AB    NOVELTY - Detecting (M1) an effort to thwart effective operation of a detector of material involves: introducing nullifying material in an area in which a detector of material is located, where the nullifying material for adversely impact operation of the detector of material so that detection of material is inhibited or prevented, and detecting introduction of the material.
   USE - For detecting an effort to thwart effective operation of a detector of material; for dispersing material in an area to affect the sense of smell of an animal (all claimed); for controlling the direction of the emission or ONM or descanter into an area; for detecting efforts to inhibit or nullify the olfactory function of a service animal or sniffer dog trained to detect material, substances, drugs, contraband, or explosives; for locating a person or device attempting to thwart detection by such an animal or dog.
   ADVANTAGE - The method enable it to advance detection technology for detecting efforts to thwart service animals and sniffer dogs or analogous machines; is unique, efficient, nonobvious systems for detecting efforts to thwart the use of detectors such as service animals, search dogs, and sniffer dogs used in detecting materials, substances (chemical or biological), drugs, contraband and explosives; provide location of an apparatus or of a person who is attempting to inhibit, nullify, or destroy the olfactory function of a service animal (or the analogous function of a machine).
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are included for the following:
   (1) dispersing (M2) material in an area to affect the sense of smell of an animal involving: introducing material into the area with an emitting apparatus including control apparatus and additionally involving controlling the emitting apparatus with the control apparatus so that material is emitted in a direction downwind of the emitting apparatus; and
   (2) a computing unit with computer-readable media having computer executable instructions for performing steps of a method of introducing material in an area in which a detector of material is located, where the material for adversely impact operation of the detector of material so that detection of material is inhibited or prevented, where the detector of material is an animal and the nullifying material is olfactory-affecting material for affecting a sense of smell of the animal.
TF TECHNOLOGY FOCUS - INSTRUMENTATION AND TESTING - Preferred Unit: The computing unit has computer-executable instructions for facilitating provision by a control system of monitoring material presence in the area; determining an identity of material in the area; determining a location within the area of material being introduced into the area; determining a location within the area of a person who is introducing material into the area; providing a signal to an animal which is a non-olfactory signal so that the animal can then provide an alert or alarm; activating a camera for monitoring and recording the area, persons in or near the area, exits and entries to the area of persons, things, and animals; activating apparatus to introduce counteractive material into the area for neutralizing material used to adversely affect a detector; removing material from the area; activating apparatus to lock down the area and impede entry to and exit from the area; and providing signals indicating material is being introduced into the area, material is being dispersed in the area, an identity of the material.
   TECHNOLOGY FOCUS - ORGANIC CHEMISTRY - Preferred Components: The nullifying material is olfactory-nullifying material (ONM). Preferred Method: When the detector of material is an animal, then the nullifying material is olfactory-nullifying material for inhibiting the sense of smell of the animal. The introducing the nullifying material is done by a person who introduces the nullifying material into the area using a material introduction apparatus. The method further involves: providing a location of the person, and/or providing a location of the material introduction apparatus; introducing counteractive material into the area to neutralize the nullifying material; evacuating the nullifying material from the area; nullifying material emitted from a carrier, allowing the carrier to proceed a distance from the detector of material, stopping the carrier a distance apart from the detector of material; rendering the carrier inoperative or destroying the carrier. When a control system controls the detector of material and then the method further involves: use of control system monitoring material presence in the area; determining an identity of material in the area; and determining of a location within the area of material being introduced into the area; the control system that provides functions of monitoring material presence in the area; determining an identity of material in the area; determining a location within the area of material being introduced into the area; determining a location within the area of a person who is introducing material into the area; providing a signal to an animal which is a non-olfactory signal so that the animal can then provide an alert or alarm; activating a camera for monitoring and recording the area, persons in or near the area, exits and entries to the area of persons, things, and animals; activating apparatus to introduce counteractive material into the area for neutralizing material used to adversely affect a detector; removing material from the area; activating apparatus to lock down the area and impede entry to and exit from the area; and providing signals indicating material is being introduced into the area, material is being dispersed in the area, an identity of the material. The material introduced into an area is ONM. When the detector of material is mounted on a carrier, where the carrier is one of drone, plane, helicopter, glider, automobile, tank, train, personnel carrier, transporter, boat, subway, raft, snowmobile, tracked vehicle, robot, trailer, wheeled transport, hovercraft, or truck, and then the method further involves: moving the detector on the carrier with respect to the area. The material emitted by the emitting apparatus is ONM. When the emitting apparatus includes timer apparatus and then the method (M2) further involves timing emission of material from the emitting apparatus, and introducing attractant into the area to attract an animal. When the emitting apparatus is on a structure and is positionable from within the structure using its part that extends into the structure, then the method (M2) further involves: within a structure, manipulating part of the emitting apparatus extending into the structure to position the emitting apparatus on the outside of the structure. Preferred Components: The olfactory-nullifying material is ozone, chlorine, or an oxidizer.

AB    NOVELTY - The method involves causing a computerized predictor apparatus to generate a plant control output based on a sensory context at first time instance. The predictor apparatus is configured to provide the predicted plant control output as a teaching input into a learning process. The predictor apparatus is caused to generate the predicted plant control output based on the sensory context and the teaching input subsequent to the first time instance at second time instance, where the predicted plant control output causes a plant to perform an action consistent with the sensory context.
   USE - Method for predicting a plant control output by a computerized predictor apparatus (claimed) i.e. adaptive computerized predictor apparatus, of an autonomous robotic device for applications. Uses include but are not limited to a surgical robot i.e. iRobot Roomba (RTM: autonomous robotic vacuum cleaner), rover, bi-pedaling robot, wheeled vehicle, aerial drone and a robotic limb, for assembly and packaging manufacturing applications, medical applications, safety applications, military applications and exploration applications.
   ADVANTAGE - The method allows an adaptive predictor of the robotic device to utilize prior sensory experience and improve prediction performance as illustrating by absence of collisions associated with a trajectory during traversal of the trajectory, thus producing target performance at lower cost. The method allows an adaptive predictor apparatus to be configured to learn to anticipate obstacles, thus allowing faster and smoother anticipatory avoidance behavior. The method allows the adaptive predictor apparatus to speed-up and improve reliability of object detection in presence of noisy and poor sensory information. The method enables predicting the plant control output by the computerized predictor apparatus of the autonomous robotic device in an effective manner.

AB    NOVELTY - The method involves obtaining an indication related to imparting a flight attribute corresponding to an unoccupied flying vehicle (UFV) (102). Flight attribute inquiry and negotiation request for a flight path (312) are received from a remote UFV (102R). A flight attribute update procedure with a plan for imparting flight characteristics is retrieved from a memory. The indicator of the flight attribute corresponding to the UFV is transmitted to the remote UFV based on the indication related to imparting the flight attribute through a radio frequency (RF) wireless signal.
   USE - Method for handling hazard for UFV (claimed). Uses include but are not limited to handling other unoccupied flying vehicles, occupied flying vehicles, ground, buildings or structures on ground, moving objects, weather conditions, stationary objects for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), remotely piloted vehicle (RPV), unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV), unmanned aircraft (UA), drone, optionally-piloted vehicle (OPV), remotely piloted aircraft (RPA), remotely operated aircraft (ROA), radio-controlled aircraft (R/C aircraft), unmanned-aircraft vehicle system (UAVS), unmanned aircraft system (UAS) and small unmanned air system (sUAS).
   ADVANTAGE - The UFV includes a motility mechanism that enables the UFV to fly, overcome gravitational forces, overcome wind resistance or drag, accelerate, and avoid the hazard. The method enables transmitting the indicator of the flight attribute such as predicted or estimated number of minutes left that the local UAV is able to stay in the air before fuel becomes sufficiently low that landing becomes imminent, corresponding to the UFV to the remote UFV based on the indication related to imparting the attribute.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a UFV for hazard handling.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a schematic view illustrating UFV hazard handling scenario or environment.

AB    NOVELTY - The method involves vibrating a skin surface (100) using a mechanical element (110) for a sufficient duration, sufficient frequency and sufficient displacement to result in removal of a portion of an ice layer to result in a partially deiced skin surface. The partially deiced skin surface is heated by using a heating element, where the heating is conducted from leading edge of the skin surface to trailing edge of the skin surface, and the heating the deiced skin surface results in a sufficient temperature increase in the deiced skin surface for removal of another portion of the ice layer.
   USE - Method for deicing surfaces of manned or unmanned airborne vehicle i.e. drone, and wind turbine in atmospheric condition. Uses include but are not limited to freezing rain, sleet, snow, hail and freezing temperature.
   ADVANTAGE - The method enables leading edge composite to be formed with the heating elements to withstand aerodynamic forces and to serve as membrane configured for efficient transfer kinetic and thermal energy, and enables adapting the mechanical element to be provided with vibration elements configured for vibrating the surface for sufficient duration, the frequency and the displacement, thus reducing accumulation of ice on the skin surface.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The mechanical element is an actuator-type mechanical element. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a system for deicing surfaces of airborne vehicles.

AB    NOVELTY - The method involves analyzing a set of thermal images to determine a global contrast range by a level analyzer in a memory e.g. static RAM (SRAM). A contrast level of each thermal image is adjusted based on the global contrast range by scaling an individual temperature range of the thermal image to match the global temperature range by a contrast converter. A composite image is generated based on the images by an image generator. A user indicated temperature range is received outside of which temperatures are excluded, where the memory is in communication with a processor e.g. microprocessor.
   USE - Method for providing global contrast correction of an aerial thermal image for a terrain of a vehicle i.e. airplane. Can also be used for a flight e.g. helicopter, glider, drone, powered parachute and glider, and a land-or-water-based travel vehicle.
   ADVANTAGE - The method enables generating the composite image based on the thermal images and providing global contrast correction of the thermal images for a terrain of a vehicle in an effective manner.

AB    NOVELTY - The system has a set of cameras which contains three or more cameras (110) mounted to a camera mounting frame (100) at different respective lens orientations relative to each other. The mounted camera of the set of cameras is provided with a different respective field of view facing outward from the camera mounting frame. A support element (115) is coupled to the mounting frame and projecting outward from the mounting frame at an orientation passing through an intersection of the different respective field of views of three adjacent mounted cameras of the set of cameras.
   USE - Camera system.
   ADVANTAGE - The corner mounted camera rig is flexible system that is adjusted to fit various purposes while maintaining the nadir reducing or eliminating features of the disclosed camera system. The camera system is capable of providing the lightweight and compact solution to capture spherical and/or panoramic images and/or video. The small, compact size decreases or reduces parallax errors to manageable minimum. The small size and the low weight of the system makes incredibly versatile for the user to carry on monopod by hand or for mounting to balloons, blimps or small drones or bike handlebar. The geometry is used to ensure full spherical coverage without nadir hole and with freedom to hold the rig in any direction/orientation. The corner mount enables the removal the physical support by masking during the stitching process resulting in obstruction-free or obstruction-reduced images and/or video. The corner mount in conjunction with the camera mount geometry provides the user with the freedom to orient or position the rig anywhere in space. The additional cables, recording devices or computers are not necessary using cameras that are completely self-contained. Thus, the camera system provides obstruction-free, fully spherical image and video capture to record spherical images or spherical videos in which the nadir hole and/or physical support element of the camera system is eliminated or reduced in size during the digital stitching process of the image or video. The camera system minimizes, reduces, and/or eliminates blind spots resulting from the presence of support element used to support the panoramic or spherical camera system.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for a mounting system for cameras.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a perspective view of the camera system.

AB    NOVELTY - The mechanism (100) has a linkage arrangement for converting rotation of a motor into a three-dimensional cyclic wing motion of each of wings (120). The arrangement includes torque-transmitting couplings extending from inside a main frame (110) into wing structures to transmit an alternating pivoting motion of the motor to a distal end of one of a first set of torsion-responsive tubes. Each coupling extends inside a shoulder joint, second and third sets of torsion-responsive tubes, an elbow joint, a wrist joint and the first set of torsion-responsive tube of a wing structure.
   USE - Wing flapping mechanism for use in flying machines e.g. ornithopters and orthopters, as imitating the way birds, insects and animals with wings are flying. Can also be used for robotics, toys, military drones, animatronics for motion pictures, exhibitions, theme or amusement parks, art kinetic structures and educational presentations.
   ADVANTAGE - The configuration of the wing flapping mechanism allows the mechanism to imitate the way birds, insects and animals with wings are flying, in a simple manner, while allowing the wing flapping motions to be fully optimized during a flight.

AB    NOVELTY - The vehicle has a part following a determined motion trajectory of contact location of a virtual element in a scene, where the part of the vehicle is extremity of a stick (S) rigidly attached to the vehicle such that the extremity of the stick is accessed without danger of getting hurt by propellers, the vehicle is fixed by ovales and non-coplanar physical markers (M) are represented by blackfilled disks. The markers define a 3D coordinate system (S-UAV) for the vehicle. An optical motion capture system tracks locations of the physical markers in images captured by cameras (C1).
   USE - Unmanned aerial vehicle i.e. drone.
   ADVANTAGE - The non-coplanar physical retro-reflective markers are attached to the drone to feed into navigation control process to improve stability and accuracy of the motion trajectory, so that vehicle shoots scene and minimal separation distance between the vehicles is maintained at all times, thus avoiding aerodynamic interference of the vehicle. The vehicle allows a control loop within a position control module to generate function of the positional error, values of attitude angles and pitch that can stabilize attitude of the drone and ensure linear displacement so as to compensate positional error.

GA 2014R51243
AB    NOVELTY - The method involves acquiring (40) aerial mapping of an agricultural plot containing a vegetable crop by a drone with a fixed aerofoil, where the plot includes an affected zone comprises less vegetable activity. The affected zones of less vegetable activity are identified (70). A detailed observation of vegetable species inside the affected zone is performed (100) by acquisition of detailed images by the drone with revolving aerofoil. A cause for least vegetable activity inside the affected zone is sought automatically (120) from the detailed observation.
   USE - Method for analysis of a cultivated agricultural plot.
   ADVANTAGE - The cause for least vegetable activity inside the affected zone is sought automatically from the detailed observation, thus allowing analysis of the cultivated agricultural plot with increased reliability and reduced costs. The plants located in the affected zone are analyzed by the drone with the revolving aerofoil in a simplified and economic manner. The drones are able to hover at low altitude, thus allowing to acquire detailed image and to acquire sample of the vegetables in the affected zone. The method limits the risks of propagation of the factor for least vegetable activity to outside of the affected zone.

GA 2014R51240
AB    NOVELTY - The method involves acquiring an image of an infrastructure using a fixed-wing drone having a hyperspectral imaging device and a geolocation device (30), and recording the geographic coordinates of the position of the drone at the time of image acquisition. An area of vegetation located within a risk zone of the infrastructure is identified (50) on the captured image, where the risk zone is defined as a portion of the space located at a distance less than a set value from the infrastructure. The coordinates of the vegetation area within the risk zone are transmitted (100) to an operator.
   USE - Method for monitoring the state of vegetation around an infrastructure e.g. electricity transmission line, aerial telecommunication line, a rail track, and a transport infrastructure suspended by a cable such as cable car and gondola lift (all claimed).
   ADVANTAGE - The use of the drone equipped with the hyperspectral imaging allows difficult to reach zones of the infrastructure to be supervised in a reduced time while reducing the cost of implementation. The method allows automatic determination of the coordinates of the vegetation area within the risk zone, thus enabling the operator to be directed to cut and/or clear growth of vegetation only towards the risk zone, and hence saving time and cost.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a flowchart of a method for monitoring an infrastructure.

AB    NOVELTY - The method involves ascertaining a target (708) for collision (710) with an unoccupied flying vehicle (UFV) (102). A command (720) is transmitted to execute a maneuver (716) to divert the UFV toward the target to induce the collision with the UFV and the target. Another UFV is selected as the target for the collision, where the latter UFV is selected as the target partially based on a value of the latter UFV. The latter UFV is selected as the target partially based on a likelihood of recoverability from the collision.
   USE - Method for hazard handling for an UFV. Uses include but are not limited to unmanned aerial vehicle, remotely piloted vehicle, unmanned combat air vehicle, unmanned aircraft, drone and optionally-piloted vehicle.
   ADVANTAGE - The method enables utilizing a base station to transmit the command to adjust a flight path of the UFV, so that probability of the UFV colliding with a non-target object can be reduced, thus avoiding the collision with the non-target object.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included for the following:
   (1) a base station
   (2) a system for hazard handling for an UFV.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a schematic block diagram of a base station.

AB    NOVELTY - The electronic device has a two-dimensional (2D) processor (802) that receives image data from a wide-angle imaging camera (114) and determines 2D spatial feature data representing several 2D spatial features identified from the image data. An application processor (804) coupled to the 2D processor, determines three-dimensional (3D) spatial feature data representing several 3D spatial features identified based on the 2D spatial feature data.
   USE - Electronic device e.g. portable user device such as tablet computer, smartphone, notebook computer, personal digital assistant (PDA), gaming system remote, TV remote, and fixture device such as medical imaging equipment, security imaging camera system, industrial robot control system and drone control system.
   ADVANTAGE - Since the depth sensor is selective activated, the overall activation time of the depth sensor is reduced or minimized while capturing sufficient depth data to permit accurate depth determinations for identified spatial features in captured imagery. The overall power draw of the depth sensor can be reduced so that the amount of time that the electronic device can operate for a given battery charge is extended while reducing the thermal requirements of the electronic device. The delay in spatial feature detection is reduced. The interference and power consumption caused by the modulated light projector is reduced.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for a method for determining relative position/orientation of electronic device in local environment.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a block diagram illustrating the processing system of the electronic device for determining 2D and 3D spatial feature data from captured imagery of local environment.

AB    NOVELTY - The transponder has a receiving antenna (1) to receive a signal transmitted by a Doppler radar, and a transmitting antenna (2) to retransmit the signal. The signal received by the receiving antenna is amplitude-modulated before retransmitting by the transmitting antenna to produce a variation of the radar cross-section of a target i.e. aircraft, where the variation triggers a frequency shift between the signal transmitted and the signal received by the radar comparable to a Doppler echo. A low noise amplifier (21) is connected between the receiving antenna and the transmitting antenna.
   USE - Transponder for a target location system for locating a target i.e. aircraft e.g. rotary wing drone and manned helicopter, for guiding the aircraft in the landing or deck-landing phase (all claimed). Can also be used for an airplane on the ground during taxiing, a robot on the ground, or for deck-landing or docking of a ship at a quayside or at sea.
   ADVANTAGE - The signal received by the receiving antenna is amplitude-modulated before retransmitting by the transmitting antenna to produce the variation of the radar cross-section of the aircraft, thus enabling detection of fixed or slowly moving aircrafts simply and at lower cost.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a target location system.

AB    NOVELTY - The device (100) has a depth sensor including a modulated light projector (119) to project an infrared modulated light pattern (424). An imaging camera e.g. wide-angle imaging camera (114), captures reflection of the pattern. A controller modifies one of frequency, intensity and duration of projections of the pattern by the projector responsive to a trigger event, where the event comprises a lapse of a timer. The controller increases one of the frequency, intensity and the duration of projections of the pattern responsive to the device being located in a previously-unencountered environment.
   USE - Electronic device i.e. tablet computer, for use at an office building or a shopping mall. Can also be used as a smartphone, notebook computer, personal digital assistant (PDA), gaming system remote, TV remote, medical imaging equipment, security imaging camera system, industrial robot control system and a drone control system.
   ADVANTAGE - The device performs selective activation of the depth sensor so as to reduce or minimize overall activation time of the depth sensor while capturing sufficient depth data to permit accurate depth determinations for identified spatial features in captured imagery, thus reducing overall power draw of the depth sensor, and hence extending amount of time to operate the device for given battery charge while reducing thermal requirements of the device. The device allows a processor to identify two-dimensional (2D) spatial features as image data is streamed from the imaging cameras and to stream the 2D spatial features to another processor as the spatial features are identified, thus reducing delay in spatial feature detection that results from waiting for the entire image frame to be buffered before commencing spatial feature detection.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The projector is a vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL) diode-based modulated light projector. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a method for operating an electronic device.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a cross-sectional view of an electronic device.

AB    NOVELTY - The device (100) has first and second imaging cameras (114, 116) placed at first and second surfaces (104, 106) and including first and second angles of view, where the second angle of view is greater than the first angle of view. A depth sensor (120) is placed at the first surface. The depth sensor comprises a modulated light projector (119) to project a modulated light pattern. One of the first and second imaging cameras captures reflection of the modulated light pattern. The modulated light projector comprises an array of vertical cavity surface emitting laser (VCSEL) diodes.
   USE - Portable electronic device for supporting location-based functionality e.g. augmented reality (AR) functionality, visual odometry or localization and mapping (SLAM) functionality, in a local environment i.e. indoor environment by using image data i.e. wide angle view (WAV) image data, and non-image sensor data e.g.orientation reading and 6DoF reading. Uses include but are not limited to a tablet computer, computing-enabled cellular phone i.e. smartphone, notebook computer, personal digital assistant (PDA), gaming system remote, TV remote, fixture device i.e. medical imaging equipment, security imaging camera system, industrial robot control system and a drone control system.
   ADVANTAGE - The device allows an application processor to begin process of determining current position/orientation before a two-dimensional (2D) processor completes capture and processing of an image frame from the imaging camera as three-dimensional (3D) spatial feature can be determined shortly after corresponding 2D spatial feature is identified, thus rapidly determining the current position/orientation to translate to provide improved location-based functionality to the device. The device accesses and displays AR graphical overlay information in a rapid manner as the current position/orientation can be identified quicker, thus leading to less jerkiness and artifacts in a AR-enhanced imagery displayed at the device. The device selectively activates the depth sensor so as to reduce or minimize activation time of the depth sensor, while capturing sufficient depth data to permit accurate depth determinations for identified spatial features in captured imagery. The device operates the depth sensor in a burst mode, so that single small rapid sequence of depth images is captured on demand in response to trigger event types and power draw of the depth sensor can be reduced, thus extending an amount of time the device to operate for given battery charge and reducing thermal requirements of the device.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The surface is a forward-facing surface or user-facing surface. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a method for operating an electronic device.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a schematic block diagram of an electronic device to determine a position/orientation in a local environment using image sensor data and non-image sensor data.

AB    NOVELTY - The device (100) has a modulated light projector (119) for projecting an infrared light pattern. A charge coupled device based image sensor comprises a filter array overlying an array of photo-sensors and comprising a mosaic of red, green and blue color filter elements and infrared filter elements. A controller controls the image sensor to capture a color image by using a first subset of photo-sensors in a first mode and capture a depth image representing reflection of the infrared pattern using a second subset of photo-sensors in a second mode. A display is placed at a surface of the device.
   USE - Electronic device e.g. tablet computer and smart-phone, for use at an office. Can also be used as a notebook computer, personal digital assistant (PDA), gaming system remote, TV remote device, medical imaging equipment, security imaging camera system, industrial robot control system and a drone control system.
   ADVANTAGE - The device enables selective activation of the depth sensor so as to reduce or minimize activation time of the depth sensor, while capturing sufficient depth data to permit accurate depth determinations for identified spatial features in captured imagery. The device operates the depth sensor in a burst flash mode when single or small, rapid sequence of depth images is captured on demand in response to trigger event types, so that power draw of the depth sensor can be reduced, thus extending amount of time when the device can operate given battery charge, while reducing thermal requirements of the device. The device controls modulated light pattern projections or modulated light flashes in conjunction with use of an electronic rolling shutter imaging camera for depth imagery capture so as to reduce or eliminate dual-image interference. The device allows signals stored in the photo-sensors to represent some portion of IR light that seeps through the color filter elements into the photo-sensor, so that IR image data from neighboring IR photo-sensors reduces or eliminates IR crosstalk using interpolation or filtering processes. The device allows the imaging camera on a surface facing a user so as to facilitate head tracking or facial recognition or obtain additional imagery of the local environment. The image sensor implements the photo-sensors with non-uniform sizes or non-uniform distribution so as to improve signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) or minimize aliasing effect often exhibited in uniform distributions found in Bayer color filter array (CFA) patterns.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The image sensor is a global shutter sensor, a depth sensor (120) and a visual light imaging camera (114). An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for an electronic device operating method.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a schematic block diagram of an electronic device to determine relative position/orientation of objects in a local environment using image sensor data and non-image sensor data.

AB    NOVELTY - The device (10) has a frame (16) with a pair of support arms. A pair of spirally threaded shaft secured to frame provides linear motion to a device. A drive mechanism e.g. motor rotates shafts. A pair of wing assemblies (140) has pairs of end elements and side elements each. A counterweight assembly secured to each wing assembly pair, has a pair of arms each with two ends. A pair of locking devices engages threaded shafts. Each pair of wing assemblies rotates through a set number of degrees after pairs of locking devices disengage from pair of spirally threaded shaft.
   USE - Propulsion device for lifting and/or propelling person, commercial/military aircraft e.g. helicopter, airplane. Can also be used in lifting of animal, toy, pilotless remote-controlled aircraft, drone, etc.
   ADVANTAGE - The lift is generated by the pair of wing assemblies, as rotation of the wing assemblies through a set number of degrees is continued. The wing is formed from wind resistance material and thin lightweight material that is durable. The wing assemblies are permitted to rotate smoothly and efficiently in a unique pattern through 360 degrees, due to the construction of counterweight assemblies. The propulsion device is inexpensive to manufacture and is simple in construction. Various size wings are utilized by the wing assemblies and the rotational speed of the wing assemblies has the ability to be varied. The propulsion device provides both lift and propulsion to the object to move through the air in a predetermined direction and at a desired speed. The connecting shaft assures that the pair of spirally threaded shaft rotates together synchronously while they rotate in opposite directions due to the engagement of the bevel gears. The propulsion device is easily controlled and operated by the person wearing the attachment mechanism, as the rotatable grips are connected mechanically, electrically or by both mechanical and electrical connections.

AU MYRICK J J
AE MYRICK J J (MYRI-Individual)
GA 2014P60105
AB    NOVELTY - An energetic composition comprises several core-shell particles.
   USE - As energetic composition useful in explosive device (claimed) such as self-consuming munition casings, structural rocket fuel, and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), autonomous disposable or self-destructible military drones, including nanoscale silicon as an energetic component.
   ADVANTAGE - The composition facilitates storage stability, is affordable and is oxygen-stable that minimizes oxide surface layer formation and oxidative aging important for manufacture of inexpensive high energy nanosilicon powders which do not substantially degrade over time. Silicon nanoparticles are of extremely small particle size, with enormous reactive surface area in covalently bonded contact with an energetic oxidizing agent which pacifies and stabilizes the energetic silicon nanoparticles against storage degradation. The method for refining and producing silicon particles is inexpensive and scalable to high volume production.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are included for the following.
   (1) method (m1) of refining and producing silicon particles by vaporizing silicon feedstock; and
   (2) an explosive device comprising a detonator and a high explosive.
TF TECHNOLOGY FOCUS - INORGANIC CHEMISTRY - Preferred Composition: The composition has core aluminum particle having a nominal diameter of less than 1 mu and a continuous adherent silicon shell having a thickness of at least 2 nm. The core-shell particles are dispersed in an oxidizer matrix, paraffin or fluid alkane fuel. The core shell particles comprises silicon, boron, aluminum and carbon having a nominal diameter of less than 1 mu and a full oxidation enthalpy at least 7 kcal/g at 100 degrees C. Preferred Method: The method (m1) involves fully vaporizing impure silicon feedstock having aluminum and/or boron impurities with halogen, hydrogen and/or oxygen to form halide-containing or oxygen-containing boron and/or aluminum vapor; cooling to condense silicon particles to maintain aluminum and/or boron impurities as vapor components in an entraining gas stream; and separating the impurity-depleted condensed silicon from the impurity-enriched gas stream. Producing silicon particles involves fully vaporizing silicon with hydrogen above 3000 degrees C, and rapidly cooling the silicon-hydrogen gas stream to condense silicon nanoparticles having hydrogen-terminated surfaces. Producing surface passivated silicon nanoparticles involve reacting the silicon nanoparticles with an unsaturated alkene or alkyne to form covalently-bonded alkane or alkene surface coating which passivates the nanoparticles against surface oxidation; and combining the passivated silicon nanoparticles with a fuel, explosive or oxidizer. Preferred Explosive: The explosive has a detonation velocity of at least 2000 m/s adapted to produce a shock wave and reaction zone. High explosive matrix comprises 1-20 wt.% energetic silicon and/or aluminum nanoparticles and a candoluminescent material which radiates visible and ultraviolet light in greater proportion than blackbody radiation at above 1800 degrees C, such that as the shockwave and reaction zone proceeds at the detonation velocity, visible and ultraviolet light is radiated from the candoluminescent material in the superheated detonation reaction zone to heat the energetic nanoparticles in the undetonated zone adjacent the shockwave and reaction zone. This reduces the reaction initiation time and increases the exothermic reaction rate of the nanoparticles when the shockwave and detonation reaction zone reach the visible and ultraviolet heated nanoparticles. The high explosive comprises an electropulse generator and energetic metal conductors (wires, foils, screens) such that upon detonation of the high energy explosive to create a shockwave and detonation wave traveling through the explosive at a rate of at least 2000 m/s, the electric pulse generator pulses current through the energetic metal conductors embedded in the explosive as the detonation shock and reaction zone approaches and envelops the vaporized or melted energetic metal, to decrease reaction delay and increase the rate of exothermic reaction of the energetic model in the detonation reaction zone.
   TECHNOLOGY FOCUS - ORGANIC CHEMISTRY - Preferred Components: The unsaturated compound is fluorinated alkene or monomer, alkene amine or alkene alcohol.
   EXAMPLE - No suitable example given.

AB    NOVELTY - The method involves automatically verifying whether conditions for turning of an aircraft are met in the event of activation of an emergency automatic asymmetrical braking. A symmetrical braking value is automatically applied at a brake assembly (E1) if the conditions are met. The braking value is automatically distributed in differential braking between braking devices (F1, F2) of left and right main landing gears as a function of current directional command orders, so as to maintain a constant overall braking level for directional command orders below a predetermined threshold.
   USE - Method for lateral control of an aircraft i.e. taxiing aircraft e.g. civil airplane, military airplane, or drone, at an airport.
   ADVANTAGE - The braking value is automatically distributed in differential braking between the braking devices of the left and right main landing gears as the function of current directional command orders, so as to maintain a constant overall braking level for the directional command orders below the predetermined threshold, thus enabling to minimize the lateral/longitudinal coupling when asymmetrical braking is carried out to control the yawing moment of the aircraft in the event of breakdown of a nose wheel orientation system.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a device for lateral control of an aircraft.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a block diagram of a device for lateral control of an aircraft.

AB    NOVELTY - The drone cargo helicopter has a low profile elongated body (1) having set of counter rotating blades (8a,8b) coupled to an upper surface and two or more struts (4) pivotally coupled to the opposing sides or a lower surface via joints (10). The lower surface is planar to provide attachments for rigid and fixed engagement with a container (2). The struts are pivoted to a position supporting the elongated body from a ground surface by a distance greater than the helicopter height, or to another position for air travel.
   USE - Drone cargo helicopter for transporting modular containers, including inter-modal containers for transporting goods.
   ADVANTAGE - The elongated body realizes a low profile construction with a planar lower surface, since the helicopter does not require a cockpit or other structure to house the pilot. When the container is unloaded from the helicopter, the body is free of any downwardly protruding structures, realizing a lightweight and aerodynamic construction. The helicopter is also operated remotely or using an autonomous system. Preferably integrating the container to the body provides the structural strength needed to support the loaded helicopter. The struts are equipped with wheels powered by separate auxiliary power source, permitting improved maneuverability which allows the helicopter to be positioned and aligned relative to the container to be transported and omits need for separate tug to transport the helicopter. Forward and aft fairings enhance aerodynamic performance or flight performance of the helicopter.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows the perspective view of a drone cargo helicopter with an attached container and with the struts in a position for landing and or ground transport.

AB    NOVELTY - The method involves using an aircraft i.e. drone (50) equipped with a broad band directing antenna (51). A level of signal received by a dipole is measured, and phase differences between each dipole of the antenna are measured for each frequency during a rotation of the aircraft around the antenna. A quality score of the received signal is determined by comparing the signal level with a signal level expected for an angle of emission. Values of differences between a measured incident angle and a theoretical incident angle are stored in a calibration table for a value of frequency.
   USE - Method for calibrating a fixed antenna installed on top of pylon, mast or building, or in a mast of a ship.
   ADVANTAGE - The method enables avoiding movement of the antenna for calibrating or recalibrating the antenna and calibrating the fixed antenna for different angles of elevations to improve precision of the determination of elevation angle. The method enables minimizing calibration or recalibration cost of the antenna.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a system for calibrating a fixed antenna.

AB    NOVELTY - The drone has a vertical sighting camera (132) to capture images of a scene of a terrain to produce a horizontal speed. A gyro sensor, a magnetometer, an accelerometer (176) and an altimeter (174) deliver position, linear acceleration, rotation and altitude signals, respectively. A navigation unit determines position coordinates (X- Z) of the drone. An image analysis unit implements a Kalman filter estimator (172) incorporating a representation of a dynamic model of the drone, with the input of the horizontal speed, position, linear acceleration, rotation and altitude signals.
   USE - Rotary wing drone i.e. quadricopter.
   ADVANTAGE - The image analysis unit implements the Kalman filter estimator incorporating the representation of the dynamic model of the drone, with the input of the horizontal speed, position, linear acceleration, rotation and altitude signals, thus enabling the drone to locate itself, without communication with outside, from the signals delivered by a series of preexistent simple sensors, with a raised precision, typically a centimetric precision. The drone allows position control with compensation of drift phenomenon of the sensors due to the effects of the wind or displacements of the mass of air in which the drone evolves.

AB    NOVELTY - The instrument has string-set bridges which are provided to create sound qualities by virtue of being placed on a sounding board. The specific section is tuned independently so that reduction in inharmonious sounds is attained. Strings are pressed down with greater range to bend notes with much more control and articulation. Drone effect is performed by bowing the low bass on one side while picking on the other.
   USE - Single-sided multi-stringed instrument.
   ADVANTAGE - The specific section is tuned independently to achieve reduction in inharmonious sounds, and the strings are pressed down with greater range to bend notes with much more control and articulation. The double sided modification design is allowed to provide extra access to strings and octaves, and provide greater control and articulation in sound creation. The extension opens up several opportunities so as to enhance the capacity of the instrument and reduce undesirable overtones inherent in the design.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a schematic view of the single-sided multi-stringed instrument.

AB    NOVELTY - The method involves generating data set comprising geometric data representing a track. The track properties are estimated by analyzing the data set to generate corresponding track property data. A template for pace note generation is generated during a learning phase including receiving set of externally generated pace notes of learning track and matching externally generated pace notes with track property data of learning track. A driving support product comprising a set of pace notes for the track is generated by applying the template to the track property data.
   USE - Method for generating driving support product for racing driver of car. Can also be used in air based vehicle such as helicopter or drone.
   ADVANTAGE - Since the template for the generation of pace notes related to the track properties is generated, the pace notes can be generated for any track after having determined the track properties, without the driver and co-driver having to actually drive on track with vehicle, while providing freedom of choice of trajectory, and allowing for driving without co-driver. Thus, the better performance and maximum security for the participants of the competition can be obtained.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for a support system for generating driving support product.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a block diagram of the system for generating driving support product for racing driver.

AB    NOVELTY - The adaptive lens (100) has a fluid-filled chamber which is located within an optical and acoustic path of the lens. The elastomeric and optically, acoustically transparent membranes (102,103) are located within an optical and acoustic path of the lens and partially bounding multiple fluid-filled chambers comprising silicone oil. The membrane is configured such that a shape of the membrane is altered upon receipt of an electric field. The optically and acoustically transparent electrodes (111A,111B) comprising carbon nanotubes, are provided to apply electric field to the membrane.
   USE - Adaptive lens for use in cell phone camera and aerial drone. Uses include but are not limited to image sensor, medical endoscope, machine vision applications, phased array, laser, lenslet array, lithotripsy, medical imaging, ultrasound, dichroic filters and/or mirrors.
   ADVANTAGE - The image distortion and chromatic and/or spherical aberrations within a single lens can be reduced by the multiple chamber lens. Since the electric field applied to an adaptive lens is rapidly adjusted, the optical and acoustic properties of the lens can also be adjusted. Thus, the material of the lens can respond quickly. Compact, low power consumption with rapid image response capability lens is provided.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for a method of producing a lens.

AB    NOVELTY - The method involves obtaining an indicator of a flight attribute corresponding to a first unoccupied flying vehicle (UFV) (102).The indicator of the flight attribute corresponding to the first UFV is transmitted to a second UFV, where a base station (306) transmits a transmission (308T) to or receives a reception (308R) from the first UFV, a remote UFV (102R) and a pilot-occupied flying vehicle (POFV) (302), the first UFV is in communication with the remote UFV, and the POFV includes a vehicle that is currently controlled by an onboard human pilot.
   USE - Method for facilitating hazard handling for a base station (claimed) by coordinating UFV for military or governmental purposes at building construction site, agricultural site and warehouse site. Uses include but are not limited to a unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), remotely piloted vehicle (RPV), unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV), unmanned aircraft (UA), drone, optionally-piloted vehicle (OPV), remotely piloted aircraft (RPA), remotely operated aircraft (ROA), radio-controlled aircraft (R/C aircraft) and an unmanned-aircraft vehicle system (UAVS).
   ADVANTAGE - The method enables transmitting indicator of the flight attribute corresponding to the first UFV to the second UFV, thus facilitating hazard handling for a base station by coordinating the UFV in an efficient manner while preventing unauthorized tampering of the vehicle.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included for the following:
   (1) a base station for facilitating hazard handling
   (2) a system for facilitating hazard handling for UFV.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a schematic block diagram of UFV hazard handling scenario or environment.

AB    NOVELTY - The station (20) has a parcel box carried by a drone and handled to the ground station such that the parcel box is modified to slowly move inside the ground station depending on half-braked wheels and guide to a carrier-casing of the drone. The parcel box is divided into cells. Each cell of the parcel box is provided with a sub-parcel that faces a mini-gate (25) in the ground station. The ground station is divided into coupled columns (30), an inlet column (31) and an outlet column (32). A data entry key board (38) transfers data of code entered to a memory of the ground station.
   USE - Autonomous ground station for interfacing aerial delivery for autonomously handling reception of smart boxes inclosing parcel such as gifts, books and governmental documents, from a drone i.e. unmanned aerial vehicle such as pilotless aircraft and remote piloted vehicles, delivering content in a sub-parcel to specific person and returning back empty smart parcels to the drone in courier service and governmental departments.
   ADVANTAGE - The station can be permanently covered with a ceiling over due to the station located in indoor or outdoor, so that the station can be prevented from being damaged. The parcel box is handled to the station, so that the parcel box is modified to move slowly inside the station depending on the half-braked wheels and guide to the carrier-casing of the drone, thus achieving quick service delivery of the parcels by drones interfaced to receivers with practical and safe to use and time-saving.

AB    NOVELTY - The method involves identifying pierce points within threshold distance from a grid point on a sphere. The grid point and other grid points for which a number of the pierce points exceeds a threshold number are selected. Vertical accuracy information at each grid point is computed (Step 2) based on vertical residual information of the pierce points. Scale factor is computed based on the accuracy information computed for each grid point. Accuracy information for an ionosphere model is generated based on the accuracy information computed for the grid points and the scale factor.
   USE - Method for generating accuracy information for an ionosphere model calculated using a parameter estimation procedure e.g. least square adjustment procedure and Kalman filter (all claimed), in a global navigation satellite system (GLONASS) positioning system e.g. global positioning system, galileo system and compass system, to estimate a position of a rover based on phase observations made using ground stations for industrial positioning applications. Uses include but are not limited to agricultural machinery positioning applications, civil construction machinery positioning applications, mining machinery positioning applications, geodetic survey equipment positioning applications, marine survey equipment positioning applications, photogrammetry applications i.e. unmanned aerial vehicle positioning applications or drone positioning applications, geographic information system equipment positioning applications and position monitoring system positioning applications e.g. earthquake detection system positioning applications, bridge monitoring system positioning applications and dam deformation system positioning applications.
   ADVANTAGE - The method enables making use of carrier phase observations having fixed or converged ambiguities so as to improve the accuracy information of the ionosphere model and offer a possibility to provide residuals to the estimated ionosphere model, which properly reflects true errors of the ionosphere model, thus reducing convergence times of a rover station provided with the accuracy information.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included for the following:
   (1) a computer program comprising a set of instructions for generating accuracy information for an ionosphere model calculated using a parameter estimation procedure
   (2) a processing entity for generating accuracy information for an ionosphere model calculated using a parameter estimation procedure.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a flow chart illustrating a process for facilitating computation of an accuracy indicator within an ionosphere processor.
   Step for computing pierce point coordinates and phase residuals mapped to vertical (Step 1)
   Step for computing vertical accuracy information at each grid point (Step 2)
   Step for providing accuracy indicators for grid points (Step 3)
   Step for computing spherical harmonic coefficients (Step 4)

AB    NOVELTY - The method involves taking (102A, 102B) sequences of raw images of a same scene, and calculating (103A, 103B) an own movement at each image sequence with respect to a camera. Total movement of the cameras is calculated (110) from the image sequences, and a residual movement is calculated for each camera from the own movement and the total movement. Each sequence of residual movement images is corrected (112A) with respect to the camera. Each sequence of images is stabilized by image by image to compensate for parasitic movements of image.
   USE - Method for compensating differential movement between cameras of aircraft e.g. piloted aircraft or unmanned aircraft such as drone, subjected to same global movement with respect to a scene.
   ADVANTAGE - The method allows easy interpretation of three-dimensional images produced from the compensated sequences of image by the human eye, thus improving visual rendering quality of the sequence of images from the cameras and avoiding possible headaches.

AB    NOVELTY - The in-line staged aircraft (102) has launch and flight vehicles (104,106) that are configured to join along a common center line and move between joined and separated configurations. The in-line staged aircraft is configured to takeoff horizontally in the joined configuration. In the joined configuration, at least one launch vehicle wing (112a,112b) is positioned adjacent to at least one flight vehicle wing (114a,114b), operating as a single airfoil. The flight vehicle (106) is an unmanned drone, such as a high-altitude, long-endurance drone.
   USE - In-line staged aircraft optimized for multiple phases of flight.
   ADVANTAGE - Facilitates optimization of an aerospace vehicle during some or all phases of flight. Enables land-based recovery and reintegration of staged aerospace vehicles and aircraft without using extensive ground support equipment. Enables drones to achieve a station altitude without an onboard jet engine or fuel tanks, reach station altitude with no power drain, and remain on station longer. Enables an aerospace vehicle to perform in a manner more closely tailored to the unique demands and opportunities of that flight phase. The launch vehicle comprises one or more engines, e.g. bi-propellant rocket engine, solid rocket motor, turbojet engine, turboprop engine, configured to provide sufficient power to enable powered flight of the multi-stage aircraft. The wing portions of the launch vehicle are configured to allow the flight vehicle to fly without being connected to the launch vehicle. The mid-flight removal of the powerful engines necessary for the flight vehicle to ascend to an operational altitude and travel to an operational area enables a higher fraction of the drone's payload to be devoted to a useful equipment, e.g. cargo, personnel, remote sensing equipment, weaponry, navigation equipment, communications equipment, fuel.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included for the following:
   (1) a launch vehicle;
   (2) a flight vehicle; and
   (3) a method for operating flight and launch vehicles together.

AB    NOVELTY - The system (100) has an IR projector (112) that projects a beam of IR radiation onto an object (132-1) at a wavelength. An IR detector (114) with a field of view of the object detects IR fluorescence from the object. A processor (103) executes an algorithm to control the IR projector to generate IR at the wavelength and project the IR onto the object. The algorithm controls IR detector to detect object fluorescence and identifies object as friendly when the object fluorescence is detected. An inhibitor (118) prevents firing of a gun/missile when object is identified as friendly.
   USE - System for preventing friendly fire using infrared (IR) object recognition, for use with military application such as gun, military aircraft, tank, anti-aircraft gun and heavy artillery (all claimed). Can also be used in system used with drone plane and ammunition or missile launch system.
   ADVANTAGE - The inhibitor prevents firing of gun/missile when object is identified as friendly, so that system efficiently prevents friendly fire. The projector creates oscillating or pulsed IR beam and IR detector captures images of the object both when illuminated and not illuminated by the beam from IR projector. Thus, the detection of friendly IR fluorescing material is improved.

AB    NOVELTY - The conveyor (20) has a motorized carrier-plate (21) hanged from a side via two ropes and rolled around two pulleys (26), where the pulleys are installed on a drive shaft (27) and driven by a motor (28) such that the motor moves the carrier-plate vertically up-down through a duct (22). The carrier-plate receives a parcel (24) dropped from a drone (23) through the duct while a conventional side scanner is fixed on an inner surface of the duct, and scans a conventional fluorescent code label (30) printed on a side of the parcel. A distance meter (35) is installed on a side of the carrier-plate.
   USE - Autonomous postal conveyor for interfacing aerial delivery such as food delivery, gifts or books delivery and governmental documents delivery, for handling reception of smart parcels from unmanned aerial vehicles i.e. pilotless aircraft or remote piloted vehicles e.g. drones, and delivering the smart parcels to a specific compartment inside an office, flat and floor in towers for courier service and governmental departments. Can also be used for ground delivery without use of drones.
   ADVANTAGE - The control unit of the conveyor runs the side motors to unwrap the ropes from the pulleys to let the carrier-plate move down with the parcel until reaching the floor in which the compartment is located, so that the hydraulically piston supported side-plate pushes the box toward the retardable door of the compartment so as to let the parcel to be moved inside the compartment, thus providing fastest ever service of delivery by the drones to be interfaced to make delivery from the drones to receivers in practical, safe, secure, and time saving manner, and allowing a revolutionary development in postal service to take industry steps forward with addition and creation of concepts for industry, performing delivery of different types and sizes of materials, parcels, documents and foods based on types of commercial handling, and developing urban planning, communication styles and drones routing.

TI Method for determining field of view e.g. field of fire for e.g. weapon of soldier, involves analyzing sensor data and geographic location at which sensor data is generated to determine field of view.
AU KELLY J T
AE ROCKWELL COLLINS INC (ROCW-C)
GA 2014K73256
AB    NOVELTY - The method (800) involves receiving (802) sensor data regarding a field of view. A geographic location at which the sensor data is generated is determined (804). The sensor data and geographic location are analyzed to determine (806) the field of view. The field of view from geographic locations is aggregated into collective field of view. The collective field of view of fire for weapon is provided (808) to an electronic display. An alert is generated based on whether geographic location associated with a first field of fire is located within a second field of fire.
   USE - Method for determining field of view such as field of fire for aimed device e.g. weapon such as firearm, mortar, or other projectile weapon, firefighting device, and camera of individual such as soldier, firefighter, police officer, emergency medical technician, rescue worker, drone and vehicle. Can also be used in intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance (ISR) device, water nozzle, less-than-lethal device, or any other form of aimed device.
   ADVANTAGE - Since the sensor data is used, the field of view, the hazardous condition, the collective field of view, the positions and orientations for individuals can be automatically determined to optimize the collective field of view. Since the sensor is used to automatically detect the boundaries, the armed individual can rapidly update his field of fire through the performance of a simple motion and the fields of fire can be quickly assessed for the moving individuals when deployed individuals are moving. Since the obstacle data is determined automatically using stored data regarding the terrain, the location of certain landmarks within the field of view can be retrieved. The data is shared between the deployed individuals to alert an individual to a hazardous condition.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a flowchart illustrating the process for determining field of view.

AB    NOVELTY - The aero-carrier (20) has a big drone carrying and supporting two levels of trays such as top tray (21) and bottom tray (22). Each tray is divided into multiple compartments (23) for supporting loaded mini drones e.g. taxi drones, or parcels. A motor (27) rotates first and second pulleys to rotate first and second strings (30, 32) that are connected to the top and bottom trays through first and second metallic extensions (31, 33) successively. The trays are loaded with the parcels, which are unloaded by the local mini drones approaching the aero-carrier to unload.
   USE - Drone service aero-carrier for carrying loaded mini drones e.g. taxi drones and unmanned aerial vehicle such as pilotless aircraft and remote piloted vehicle, or parcels in commercial and governmental sector, hospitals and traffic control to a work area i.e. ground hub, in applications. Uses include but are not limited to thermal or video camera imaging, parcels delivery, farming, surveying of crops, acrobatic aerial footage in filmmaking, search and rescue operations, construction industry, inspecting powerlines, dams, pipelines, counting wildlife, delivering medical supplies to remote or inaccessible regions, determining of illegal hunting by animal-rights advocates, livestook monitoring, wildfire mapping, pipeline security, home security, road patrol, anti-piracy, search and rescue, dropping life preservers to swimmers, damage assessment and all-weather imaging through clouds, rain and fog in daytime or night times conditions in real-time.
   ADVANTAGE - The aero-carrier provides an aero-carrier drone for delivering loaded mini drones from an aero-space or to land to deliver the parcels directly to a ground hub. The aero-carrier utilizes a mechanism for loading and unloading gap adjustment for protecting the loaded items from falling down while in flight. The aero-carrier can land to unload the parcels to a local delivery hub or while the aero-carrier is in hovering or in flight at low height, where a mini drone approaches for direct unloading to carry the parcels and distribute the aero-carrier to specific points of delivery, thus saving load of mini drones carried with the parcels in the aero-carrier. The trays are perforated from down side for preventing accumulation of rain water and dust. The aero-carrier reshapes and reconstructs lower aerospace traffic to be less crowded with high organized, efficient and beneficial.

AB    NOVELTY - The assembly (10) has a motion sensor (9) with a first and a second analog photoreceptor (17) each adapted for observing moving contrast. An angular velocity calculating unit (14) comprises a thresholding and interpolating stage (28) for temporally sampling the analog signals delivered by first and second photoreceptor at a given sampling frequency to obtain a first and second digital signal respectively. The interpolation of first and second digital signal is performed when they cross a predetermined threshold between successive samples.
   USE - Motion sensor assembly for use in vehicle such as terrestrial, maritime or aerial vehicle, micro aerial vehicle, motor vehicle, drone or space vehicle (all claimed).
   ADVANTAGE - Since the computational load allowed by the interpolation is reduced, the number of pixels processed by the same calculation unit is multiplied to increase the accuracy of the sensor by multiplying the number of sensors covering the same area. The measured temporal delays can be greater, thus the sampling frequency can be reduced even without loss in measurement accuracy. Since the angular velocity calculating unit comprises a stage for performing an interpolation of first and second digital signal when they cross a predetermined threshold between successive samples, the motion sensor assembly can be improved and such that multidimensional angular velocity can be measured and larger photoreceptor arrays can be used, while keeping the desired measurement accuracy.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for a method for determining the angular velocity of a moving contrast.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a block diagram of the motion sensor assembly.

AB    NOVELTY - The vehicle e.g. micro drone (10) has propellers, and a suction cup (20) attaching the vehicle to a smooth vertical wall (24) on which the vehicle does not rest under gravity effect alone without being powered. A detachment unit formed of pin, thread and remote controlled extraction actuator detaches the vehicle from the wall. The cup is placed at periphery of the vehicle. The pin is placed in vicinity of edge of the cup to fix the thread. The actuator is fixed on a structure of drone opposite to the pin to exert traction on the thread and cause separation of the cup from the wall.
   USE - Aerial vehicle e.g. remote operated fixed-wing type mini-drone or micro-drone, used for monitoring sensitive areas, remote operated or autonomous monitoring or recognition missions in urban environment and at exterior and/or interior of building.
   ADVANTAGE - The micro drone is attached in a location to continue the observation for specific time by consuming less energy during the stopping of the propellers. The suction cup attaches the vehicle to the wall in an easy manner.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included for the following:
   (1) a method for detaching aerial vehicle from a support
   (2) a kit for transforming a remote operated fixed-wing type vertical takeoff micro-drone.

AB    NOVELTY - The nozzle (135) has a fuel conduit (160) integrally formed with a mixing tube (175) and placed on a forward edge of the mixing tube. An opening (181) passes through the fuel conduit, and is directed radially into the mixing tube. A circular shaped plate is integrally formed with the mixing tube, and conforms to a shape of an annulus. The mixing tube includes an annular wall that is placed partially on an aft side of the nozzle, and is extended to the fuel conduit on a first end of the fuel conduit, where a slot is created between the fuel conduit and a second end of the fuel conduit.
   USE - One-piece fuel nozzle for use in a jet engine i.e. miniature gas turbine engine or turbojet engine, for single usage and reusable applications e.g. weapon and non-weapon applications such as reconnaissance drones, cruise missiles and decoys, in air-launched and ground-launched weapon systems.
   ADVANTAGE - The nozzle allows the fuel conduit to be coupled to a platform and the mixing tube, and can precisely create the opening such that fuel can be directed to proper area within the nozzle to minimize error caused by aligning openings in tubes that are independent of the mixing tube, so that the nozzle can be cast in one-piece from a precision casting. The nozzle is designed such that static structure of the miniature gas turbine engine can be assembled together by using relatively low cost fastening techniques of threaded fasteners, welding, v-band clamps and rivets, thus providing economically feasible extended range expendable propulsion sources with highest degree of starting and operational reliability for the miniature gas turbine engine when launched from air or ground systems.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included for the following:
   (1) a nozzle assembly
   (2) a method for optimizing fuel flow to a combustion chamber.

AU NOEL J H T S
AE NOEL J H T S (NOEL-Individual)
GA 2014G58493
AB    NOVELTY - The method involves assigning munitions to an authorized person, so that authorized person is allowed to remove munitions from storage location and enclosed premises. The munitions are whether stored in storage location is continuously monitoring at a station in real time. The station is remote to enclosed premises to detect access to munitions and enclosed premises including authorized access, unauthorized access and attempted authorized access or attempted unauthorized access. Alarm is generated at station when unauthorized access is detected.
   USE - Method for managing munitions stored at police station, military base, firearms shop, security companies and private residences, in modular munitions storage system (claimed). Uses include but are not limited to arm, ammunition, weapons such as rifles, shotguns, machine guns, pistols and revolvers, large calibre anti-personnel and anti-vehicle rifles, squad automatic weapons, larger man-portable and man-operated weapons such as flamethrowers, grenade and rocket propelled grenade launchers, anti-tank or anti-bunker missile launchers and antiaircraft missile launchers, and tactical accessories, such as night vision goggles, binoculars, rifle scopes, laser aiming devices, tactical lights, personally transportable drones and remote controls.
   ADVANTAGE - The alarm is generated at the station if identity of a person possessing the weapon does not match identity of the person to whom the weapon is assigned. The automated munitions management which is monitored from a single remote station can be enabled. The unauthorized access to munitions stored at various locations can be prevented. The single remote station can be enabled to monitor and control access to multiple munitions stored at different locations. The surveillance module is mounted on such a mobile unit to ensure that reports are automatically made at varying intervals. The power supply and backup system are enclosed in a secured compartment with security features in place to avoid any sabotage or tampering. The change in employment status of an assigned person such as resignation, death, termination, discharge or new recruitment is inputted in the system and weapon assignment to the person is consequently deleted, so that unwarranted and unauthorized access by assigned person can be prevented.

GA 2014G09582
AB    NOVELTY - The blade has a driving zone (1) for rotating the blade and a collecting zone (3) for fighting against natural displacement of a structure, where the structure works together with regulation of relative speed. The blade is rotated around an axis and generates bearing pressure by using a driving surface to reduce relative speed of an environment of the blade when the blade is confronted with displacement of fluid surrounding the blade. The driving and collecting zones are fixed on an axis of rotation.
   USE - Speed regulation blade for a propeller for regulating relative speed of a structure or an object in a fluid environment and for parachuting a flying object i.e. broken multirotor drone.
   ADVANTAGE - The blade allows regulation of a rate of travel of the structure or the object within the fluid environment.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a schematic perspective view of a rotary wing.

TI Tangible computer readable medium for controlling airplane within e.g. vehicle-based combat game, has set of instructions for maintaining camera angle at directional heading, while graphically rendering rotation of vehicle.
AU SITNIKAU A
AE WARGAMING.NET LLP (WARG-Non-standard)
GA 2014G06826
AB    NOVELTY - The medium has a set of instructions for simulating a vehicle within a virtual environment using physics engine. A user input e.g. data update, identifying a directional heading is received, while maintaining the vehicle in another directional heading. A camera angle is pivoted about the vehicle to the former heading. The vehicle is caused to alter course from the latter heading to the former heading. The camera angle is maintained at the former heading, while graphically rendering rotation of the vehicle as the vehicle alters course to the latter directional heading.
   USE - Tangible computer readable medium for controlling a vehicle i.e. airplane (claimed), within three-dimensional (3D) space e.g. graphically simulated environment such as online multiplayer video game e.g. vehicle-based combat game, serious game, massive multiplayer online game, virtual reality game, 3D based education game and computer based training. Can also be used for a helicopter, glider, drone, warship, boat, submarine, tank, jeep, car, truck, rocket, missile, space shuttle and a space ship.
   ADVANTAGE - The medium enables users to partially control the vehicle using two-dimensional input devices e.g. mouse, by inputting a fresh destination for the vehicle to go to the destination based on a control mode, automatically calculating a way to control the vehicle toward the heading by game's control logic, and providing the input that indicates direction and speed of rotation to provide direct control of the vehicle control system and control surface, thus controlling the vehicle within the 3D space in a simple and efficient manner even by novice users.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The directional heading is yaw of the vehicle. INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included for the following:
   (1) a method for controlling a vehicle within 3D space
   (2) an apparatus for controlling a vehicle within 3D space.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a schematic block diagram of a network architecture and a data processing architecture for controlling a vehicle within 3D space.

AB    NOVELTY - The ducted fan has a fan blisk (12) having a set of thrust fan blades (40) extending from an outer hub (42) and a set of integral secondary flow blades (52) extending between the outer hub and an inner hub (44). A nacelle provides an outer flow duct for the thrust fan blades. A gear case shroud has an inlet concentric with the outer hub to carry secondary air flow from the secondary flow blades. The secondary air flow runs over the outer profile of a reverse flow turbine engine core. An air diffuser extends from the shroud.
   USE - Ducted fan for reverse flow turbine engine for aircraft. Uses include but are not limited to radio controlled hobby aircraft, unmanned aerial vehicles, remotely piloted vehicles, drones, and potentially piloted aircraft.
   ADVANTAGE - The secondary airflow provided by the secondary flow blades is employed as a cooling airflow for the gear case. The use of prime number of blades is employed to reduce harmonic resonance in the fan blisk. The diffuser minimizes aerodynamic losses of the thrust flow by controlling flow expansion aft of the stators between the inner geometric profile of the nacelle and the diffuser outer profile.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are included for the following:
   (1) a method for providing airflow from a ducted fan in a reverser flow turbine engine; and
   (2) a method to improve operation of a reverse flow turbine engine.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows the front view of a fan blisk with integral secondary flow blades.

AB    NOVELTY - The tire has a bolt i.e. linear unit, mounted on a tire body to be movable along radial direction relative to a tread surface (502) between a retracted position and an extended position. A lock mechanism is movable between a locked position and an unlocked position. The lock mechanism locks the bolt in the retracted position and the extended position, where the lock mechanism is biased toward the locked position with a biasing device such that the lock mechanism remains in the locked position without a need for continuous application of actuation force/energy.
   USE - Tire for a wheeled vehicle i.e. four-wheeled passenger vehicle. Can also be used for a lorry, multi-wheel axle lorry, tractor trailer, farm vehicle, recreational off road vehicle, robotics and a drone vehicle.
   ADVANTAGE - The tire includes a retractable bolt for enhancing traction on ice-covered roadways and the lock mechanism for locking the bolt in a deployed position without the need for relying on persistently maintained air pressure to keep the bolt in the deployed position. The tire uses a tire system that can avoid depletion of air pressure within the tire that can result from systems, which utilize air pressure within the tire for actuation purposes. The bolt and protrusion of the bolt can be adjusted for tread wear, weight of the vehicle and road conditions. The bolt includes a small portion that can be worn down as the system deploys studs or bolts with small fraction of an inch of protrusion beyond a surrounding tire tread, so that functionality of an adaptive tire can be maintained easily by providing the adaptive tire including bolts or studs with a replaceable tip. The tire can maintain functional engagement between the bolt and an ice covered road surface, while minimizing a number of bolts and actuators, so that mass and cost of the adaptive tire can be reduced.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included for the following:
   (1) an adaptive tire system
   (2) a method for operating an adaptive tire
   (3) a rotary union for guiding fluid between a stator shaft and a stator body.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a front elevational view of a combined tire and wheel assembly including actuators shown in phantom and manually operated valves for controlling supply of actuation air to the actuators for deployment, retraction and locking.

AB    NOVELTY - The method involves providing powder particles having a predetermined particle size distribution, where the powder particles comprise reinforcing fibers with a first average fiber orientation. Directed energy is introduced to the powder particles to provide a manufactured part (304) having a second average fiber orientation more random than the first average fiber orientation, where the second average fiber orientation is predominately random such that a manufactured pail has essentially anisotropic mechanical properties in two dimensions.
   USE - Method for manufacturing a part e.g. aerospace vehicle part such as aircraft part. Can also be used for manufacturing a mobile platform part, stationary platform part, land-based structure part, aquatic-based structure part, space-based structure part, drone part, missile part, rocket part, surface ship part, tank part, personnel carrier part, train part, spacecraft part, space station part, satellite part, submarine part, automobile part, power plant part, bridge part, dam part, manufacturing facility part and a building part (all claimed).
   ADVANTAGE - The method enables subassembly manufacturing operation and system integration operation of the aircraft in a cost-effective manner. The method enables heating nitrogen gas to avoid degrading energy supplied from a laser unit, so that any laser sintering system machine can process powder material to be used. The method enables providing the particles to flow or move through openings created by larger particles that are packed or stacked against each other, and enables a particle size distribution to allow particles to flow easily when deposited on a bed, so that increased flow of particles can obtain smooth surface for energy delivery. The fiber is extruded in combination with material matrix e.g. polymer using a compounding and extruding equipment, after selection of the fiber and fiber length distribution and diameter to provide and control a predetermined fiber length, and an impact-based size reduction process is performed at very low temperatures i.e. dry ice/acetone or liquid nitrogen temperatures, to provide a predetermined particle size distribution of powder after extrusion or other intimate co-mingling of fiber and material matrix, thus controlling the fiber length distribution and diameter adequately to provide target predetermined values, and hence maintaining sufficient stiffness and mechanical strength of the fiber at high end of the temperature range to prevent failure in service.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The reinforcing fibers are selected from the group consisting of polymer, glass, carbon and ceramic. The particle has a particle size distribution of between about 20 micrometers to about 150 micrometers and an average particle size between about 75 micrometers to about 125 micrometers. INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included for the following:
   (1) a powder for additive manufacturing
   (2) a manufactured part.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a block diagram of a part manufacturing environment.
   Manufactured part (304)
   Bed (308)
   Environmental control unit (310)
   Laser beam (314)
   Powder material (316)
TF TECHNOLOGY FOCUS - POLYMERS - The powder particles are selected from a group consisting of polyamide, polyphenylene sulfide, polyetherketoneketone, polyamide blend, polyphenylene stilfide blend and polyetherketoneketone blend.

AB    NOVELTY - The system (20) has a spring-driven mechanical linkage operatively coupled to kicker feet. A release lug selectively secures a munition (22) to the deployment system. The release lug is released to cause the linkage to push the kicker feet contacting the munition and push the munition away from the deployment system. The linkage includes a cross-link bar including opposite ends that are attached to respective kicker feet. The release lug is operatively coupled to multiple electrical solenoid actuators that are actuated to release the release lug from securement with the munition.
   USE - Deployment system for deploying a munition from an aircraft such as unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and drone aircraft, that is utilized for surveillance and targets during flight. Can also be used for sonar buoys and weather measurement devices.
   ADVANTAGE - The system has arms that include adjustable screws, where positions of the screws can be individually adjusted by screwing in or out and the screws press against the sides of the munition, thus preventing swaying of the munition while the munition is secured to the deployment system without any additional tools. The system has an electrical connector that vertically travels to some extent before separation from the mating electrical connector, so that momentum is built up before umbilical separation occurs, thus enhancing reliability and repeatability in the separation process of the munition. The system can be adapted to a variety of devices such as small munitions with standard coupling configuration with or without electrical connection, so that the munitions are deployed with desired amount of pitch in an effective manner.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a side view of an aircraft carrying a deployment system.

Ground pieces (11, 12) made of a conducting material are placed in between the dipole legs, where length of the dipole legs are ranging from 0.1 to certain meters. An axis of a dipole antenna set (5) is considered to be a line connecting innermost points of axes of the antenna legs of the dipole legs. The dipole antenna set is connected to an electronic receiving equipment using wires (9, 10).
   USE - Three-dimensional dipole antenna system for measuring oscillatory electric field strength in air or under water for frequencies ranging from 0.01 Hz to 10,000 Hz around a survey platform e.g. manned or unmanned aircraft, drone towed behind aircraft and drone suspended under helicopter. Can also be used for a drone towed behind ship, car, lorry and a stationary object.
   ADVANTAGE - The system allows the dipole antenna legs to limit noise caused by induction from varying magnetic field strength, and the dipole antenna is attached to the cylinder, where the axis of the cylinder is not coincide with an axis of the dipole antenna such that the dipole antenna legs get shape of a spiral segment, so that virtual shape of a tubular envelope enhances sensitivity of oscillatory electric signals. The system allows the dipole antenna and the ground pieces to be electrically insulated by some coating to prevent direct contact with the air or water around the dipole antenna and the ground pieces, so that the ground pieces marginally improves performance of submerged dipole antenna systems. The system introduces spiral shape to the dipole antenna leg segments to improve signal to noise ratio of low frequency electric measurements in frequency range of interest.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a perspective view of a three-dimensional dipole antenna of spiral segments on a tubular stinger of a small survey aircraft.

GA 2014C37838
AB    NOVELTY - The system (100) has a metadata collector for obtaining metadata information associated with an autonomous actor network (104) and autonomous actors (102a-102c). Each actor includes a pseudo-gene self-assessment identifier indicative of quantity of metadata information for a metadata element stored by the autonomous actor, relationship between the metadata element for the actors and the quantity of metadata information stored for the metadata element. An assessment processor generates an assessment value for the actors based on the obtained metadata information and the identifier.
   USE - Pseudo-genetic meta-knowledge based artificial intelligence system for managing an autonomous actor network. Uses include but are not limited to a cellular network, data network, local area network, wide area network, mesh network, internet, public switched telephone network, private network and a satellite network.
   ADVANTAGE - The system allows a parent to contribute a limited amount of pseudo-genetic or meta-knowledge information as determined by different evaluation functions, which are unique to each parent, thus preventing useless genes from having equal chance of being passed on as valuable genes. The system facilitates parent's evaluation of a value of pseudo-genetic or meta-knowledge and each reproductive partner's pseudo-genetic or meta-knowledge material to be changed over time, thus preventing convergence to localized extrema. The system allows pseudo-genes to be used to alter physical characteristics and behavior characteristics such that cost associated with each pseudo-gene is used to change physical characteristics or behavior characteristics, thus preventing a simulation system from collapsing into a trivial solution state. The system allows the actor with individual criteria for selecting desirable reproduction partners so as to allow incredible divergence in populations such that criteria for reproduction can vary from individual to individual, thus giving rise to highly heterogeneous actor populations to meet basic criteria for survival and boundary conditions in a given simulated environment, withstanding incredible shocks or changes to the environment and greatly reducing chances of universal exploit arising in diverse population, and hence preventing rapid convergence to a single homogeneous collection of actors.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The autonomous actors are robotic drones. The metadata information associated with autonomous actors is selected from a group consisting of measurement of height, width, weight, a total surface area, speed, armor thickness, engine output, battery life, color and property indicating how the actor interacts with the autonomous actor network. INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included for the following:
   (1) a method for managing an autonomous actor network
   (2) a tangible computer-readable storage medium comprising a set of instructions for managing an autonomous actor network.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a block diagram of a system for managing an autonomous actor network.

AB    NOVELTY - The system (100) has a transport device e.g. drone aircraft that is provided with energy transfer component e.g. antenna and a transceiver to receive wireless signal. The transport device transfers energy signal to energy harvesting monitors (20) as the transport device is within a predetermined distance of monitors. The monitor receives the energy signal from the transport device and the signal powers a wireless signal from the transceiver of the monitors to the transceiver of the transport device. The wireless signal comprises agricultural data for the agricultural area.
   USE - Center pivot system for data collection for agriculture. Can also be used in data collection for sports or recreational turf, environmental monitoring of landfills, waste sites, transportation infrastructure such as road and railway, and industrial process control.
   ADVANTAGE - Since the monitor receives the energy signal from the transport device and the signal powers a wireless signal from the transceiver of the monitors to the transceiver of the transport device, the soil parameters are measured with the sensor and the soil data is relayed to a central location effectively without the need for a battery. The expensive radio interface chips are eliminated through the use of very simple microchip implemented techniques like frequency shift key approaches that are inexpensive. Since the stimulating coil passes over the monitor that absorbs energy until a sufficient amount is harvested to allow it to make a measurement and transmit the data, the sensors are provided in the size of credit cards that is not much thicker, with no batteries.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for a system for data collection for a geographical area.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a schematic view of the center pivot system.

TI Resetting mechanism for resetting independent axles in joystick mechanical system in e.g. ship, has links realizing brake function such that restoring-, pressure- or spring forces are dependent at links when bearing is applied to one leg.
AE WEATRONIC GMBH (WEAT-Non-standard)
GA 2014B23791
AB    NOVELTY - The mechanism has interchangeable connecting links (16) realizing brake function such that a screw head fastens a bearing at a lever (12) on a resting place of a ball bearing (17). Resetting is realized such that the bearing is pressed on the links and return force is set to zero when the bearing is applied to legs of the links. A restoring force of a geometric design of the mechanism, pressure force transferred over the bearing or spring force and angle and slope or inclination of a leg contour are dependent at the links when the bearing is applied to one of the legs.
   USE - Resetting mechanism for resetting independent axles in a joystick mechanical system that is utilized in a remote control system for a ship, aircraft such as drone, and motor car, and in a professional machine controller e.g. crane or lift.
   ADVANTAGE - The restoring force of the geometric design of the mechanism, the pressure force transferred over the bearing or the spring force and angle and slope or inclination of the leg contour are dependent at the links when the bearing is applied to one of the legs, thus exchanging the links by a user in a simple manner by loosening of individual screws without disassembling the components, and defining the restoring force, the force profile and the linearity in a reliable manner. The mechanism is flexibly, quickly, easily and inexpensively adapted to various user requirements, and ensures quick exchange of the possible wearing parts of brake.

TI Aircraft e.g. rotor/wing aircraft, has one rotor/wing that is operated in coordination with other rotor/wing during transition flight mode in order to reduce destabilizing forces on fuselage resulted due to transition mode.
AU RAJESH G

GA 2013U18119
AB    NOVELTY - The aircraft (100) has two rotor/wings (102, 103) that rotate in counter-rotation to produce vertical lift during a rotary-wing mode. The rotor/wings are not rotated and one rotor/wing is positioned to produce aerodynamic lift as fixed wings, during a fixed-wing mode. When the main portion is transited between the rotary-wing mode and the fixed-wing mode during a transition flight mode, one rotor/wing is operated in coordination with other rotor/wing in order to reduce destabilizing forces on a fuselage (101) resulted due to the transition mode.
   USE - Aircraft such as rotor/wing or stop-rotor aircraft. Can also be used in micro aerial vehicles, unmanned drones, and wide variety of manned vehicles e.g. personal air vehicles used for surveillance, military, commercial and general aviation.
   ADVANTAGE - During transition between rotary-wing and fixed-wing mode, the synchronous operation of the one rotor/wing with the other rotor/wing maintains lateral balance and vertical lift. Transition is stable without the aircraft losing altitude and experiencing any dangerous turning moment. As the reactions of the two rotor/wings on the aircraft due to sudden stopping or starting are also equal and opposite, the effects on the aircraft is cancelled. The rotor/wings can be started or stopped very rapidly without affecting the flight stability. As the two rotor/wings are mounted on separate transmission systems they are less complex. The aircraft has the advantage of a very low weight and complexity penalty and can offer a better transport effectiveness than conventional helicopters and airplanes. Another advantage of the coaxially connected rotor/wings is that the airfoil cross-section of the rotor/wings can be designed to have a preferred leading and trailing edge which is most efficient for fixed-wing mode. The resulting imbalance lift of the two rotor/wings during rotary-wing mode compensates each other, without the need of complex mechanism. The coaxial rotor/wings provide all the advantages related to helicopters with coaxial rotors, such as a smaller wingspan, high stability during vertical lift, lower noise, lower vibration and higher efficiency. Since transition between rotary-wing mode and fixed-wing mode is relatively simple, the process can be automated at reduced cost. Such aircrafts can automatically convert between the two flights modes, depending on the forward speed, and can practically never stall so that a considerable reduction in skill required operating such aircraft.

AB    NOVELTY - The system (20) has a gas turbine engine that is provided with air ducts (25). The covers (28,29) are provided with inner faces (34,44) connectable to air duct. The covers are shaped to engage and close the air ducts. A desiccant (36,46) is a desiccant pack attached to the cover and is located on inner face of cover. The desiccant is attached to recesses of covers by using fastener and adhesive. Pockets are provided on inner surfaces of covers. The desiccant pack is secured in pocket. The covers are removed by pyrotechnics.
   USE - System such as propulsion system for reducing moisture in gas turbine engine of aeronautical vehicle (claimed). Can also be used in single-usage application such as reconnaissance drone, cruise missile, decoy and other weapon application including air-launched and ground-launched weapon systems.
   ADVANTAGE - Since the inlet and exhaust openings of the gas turbine engine are sealed with the covers, the humidity is prevented from entering into the gas turbine engine. Thus, the sealed and reduced moisture environment is created through the use of desiccants in combination with covers. Hence, the moisture is prevented from settling in propulsion engine when the engine is not in use before being launched. The desiccant attached to the cover can absorb any built-up moisture in the gas turbine engine. Thus, the moisture build-up in gas turbine engines can be prevented effectively. Hence, the risk of engine freezing can be reduced and engine reliability and effectiveness of gas turbine engine can be improved.

AB    NOVELTY - The method (1) involves generating a three-dimensional model for an object (2) from photographs for a particular time. A visual focus on the three-dimensional model is defined and a 2.5 dimensional view of the object is derived (3) for visual focus - in a form of a Cartesian data record. A color value derived from the three-dimensional model and a depth value derived from the three-dimensional model are recorded (4) as data attributes for a data point. The data attributes of the data point are compared (5) with corresponding data from a reference model or comparison model for the object.
   USE - Method for image-based alteration recognition for three-dimensional object e.g. missile such as aircraft and drone, carried- or satellite-carried sensor e.g. camera and scanner, and/or surface section (all claimed). Uses include but are not limited to earth's surface, land portion, urban area and building.
   ADVANTAGE - The method enables reducing complexity for recognition or ascertainment of alterations and/or differences between three-dimensional object photographs that are available in the form of point clouds in an easy manner with reduced storage space and reduced recognition cost. The data records are provided with geometric and color information for the data point, thus allowing easy recognition of alterations in a three-dimensional object. The method enables comparing the data attributes of the data point with corresponding data from the reference model or comparison model for the object in order to establish discrepancies and/or changes in a reliable manner.

AB    NOVELTY - The bearing device has shield board (4,5) provided with oil component of high temperature than the quantity of the oil component which oozes at the low temperature while fixing to a bearing ring. A solid-lubrication element (31) is provided with solid lubricant and consists of a some solid-lubrication portion mutually located at intervals. The framework portion of shield board are extended to the radial direction and mutually located in the circumferential direction at intervals.
   USE - Bearing device used for target drone mounted in fighter and helicopter.
   ADVANTAGE - Since each solid-lubrication portion is located between the circumferential directions of framework portion which is extended to the radial direction adjacent to the circumferential direction, the strength of a shield board can be enlarged in a framework portion and the unexpected destruction of a shield board can be suppressed. Since the oil component can be efficiently supplied to a sliding portion from a solid-lubrication element at the time of high temperature, the lubricity at the time of use can be improved.

AB    NOVELTY - The aircraft (1) has a rigid wing (2) enabling an aerodynamic horizontal flight. Front and rear rotors (4, 4') e.g. flap rotors, are driven by controllable electric motors (5). The rotors are pivoted between a vertical starting position and a horizontal flight position by a pivoting mechanism. The electric motors and the rotors are arranged on the wing. The electric motors and the rotors are provided in an X-shaped arrangement relative to a longitudinal axis of the aircraft. A control device controls the electric motors so that the aircraft is automatically heldable in a stable hovering.
   USE - Aircraft such as an unmanned aircraft e.g. micro aerial vehicle, a drone and an unmanned aerial system (all claimed), for monitoring and clearing purposes in civil and military applications. Uses include but are not limited to monitor observance of fishery catch quotas, overhead cables, forest stand, forest conditions, and gas and oil pipelines to early detect occurrence of leakage and to estimate maintenance requirement of the pipelines, for plant security of harbor facilities or in large industries, for environment and nature protection, for surveying damage measures after nature catastrophes, for determining animal population in a wildlife conservation area, for monitoring and maintenance of offshore facilities i.e. wind parks, and drilling and conveyor platforms, for monument protection, for testing structures of buildings, for aerial image photography, for aerial film recording, and for cartographing.
   ADVANTAGE - The rotors are arranged on the rigid wing, thus avoiding the need for starting and landing strips and/or a parachute or net landing, and hence increasing a flight duration and a range due to effective drive production in horizontal flight by the rigid wing while providing simple starting and landing characteristics and improved dynamic, vertical take-off and landing (VTOL)-characteristics relative to different application possibilities. The aircraft simplifies a design and control of the rotors and the electric motors, and enables use of same dimensioned rotors and the motors. The aircraft reduces masses of a beam, thus lifting a utilization load of the aircraft and increasing an efficiency relative to use of drive energy. The aircraft avoids the need for complex structures of starting and landing devices e.g. catapults, and cargo nets. The aircraft has a wide speed spectrum between a speed from 0 km/h in hovering to high dynamic flight speeds in a range of 300 km/h. The aircraft ensures an efficient cruise flight operation, and has a slender and efficient wing profile.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a schematic top view of an aircraft in hovering.

AB    NOVELTY - The method involves receiving data associated with a hazard e.g. geographic hazard, detected by a sensor e.g. vibration sensor. A database is updated with the data associated with the hazard. A request for updated hazard information within a geographic boundary is received from a navigation device (50) e.g. smart phone, where the navigation device calculates a proposed route based on a destination and the updated hazard information, and the proposed route is filtered by a user of the navigation device based on a class of hazards.
   USE - Computer-based method for automatically detecting and cataloging environmental hazards or obstacles e.g. geographic hazard, issue in need of repair, impediment to rate of travel, impediment to safety, nuisance, detour or strain on travel, for route planning at building, on a path, in a park, in shopping malls and in a public space using a sensor e.g. image sensor, vibration sensor, sound sensor, proximity detector, position detector, force sensor, distance sensor, laser scanner and radar sensor in a vehicle, a robot, a drone, a computer, a mobile device such as mobile phone and table computer, a navigation device such as smart phone, and a stand alone unit (all claimed).
   ADVANTAGE - The method enables allowing a participating detector to be allocated a security clearance before gaining access to populate information to the information repository, thus reducing identification of hoax hazards, and hence avoiding lost time or frustration, and planning the routes in an improved manner. The method enables automatically detecting and cataloging environmental hazards and/or obstacles for route planning in a cost effective manner.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included for the following:
   (1) a system for automatically detecting and cataloging environmental hazards or obstacles for route planning
   (2) an article of manufacture comprising a set of instructions for automatically detecting and cataloging environmental hazards or obstacles for route planning.

AB    NOVELTY - The method involves obtaining a sequence of values including a random sequence associated with a first party and a second party by the first and second parties. The data matching (507) procedure is performed to identify corresponding pairs of values in respective sequences that match the discrete-valued sequences derived from the original sequences by the first and second parties. The shared secret information is equal to or derived from the matching values in original sequences.
   USE - Method for allowing first party and second party to obtain shared secret information through unconditionally secure communication using quantum mechanical such as quantum cryptographic key distribution (QKD) and classical communication channels for use in variety of applications such as financial transactions, armed forces, navigation and location information, mobile security services, distributed networking, internet communications, satellite communications, remote command and control systems, aircraft such as drone aircraft, and identity management and security.
   ADVANTAGE - Since the shared secret information is equal to or derived from the matching values in original sequences, the information overlap between the two parties is increased by reducing the three-way information overlap between the two parties and the unknown person. Hence the method of sharing information between two parties is enabled without sharing with the unknown person where the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of second party is small than the first party.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are included for the following:
   (1) a computer program comprising instructions arranged, when executed, to implement a method for allowing a first party and a second party to obtain shared secret information; and
   (2) an system for allowing a first party and a second party to obtain shared secret information.

AB    NOVELTY - The method involves periodically calculating estimates corresponding to a pose of platform by a computer system (20). The preliminary estimates are independently calculated based on the sensor data corresponding to the type of sensor data. The estimates are generated using the preliminary estimates and a covariance matrix. The covariance matrix is adjusted based on an uncertainty for the preliminary estimate that varies based on time, distance or velocity of the platform.
   USE - Method for estimating pose such as course and heading of platform e.g. vehicle (all claimed) such as tread-driven unmanned ground vehicle e.g. iRobot, Packbot and Talon (RTM: Robotic vehicles), automated truck, waterborne vehicle, aerial vehicle e.g. predator combat drone, amphibious vehicle, rail vehicle, car and submersible vehicle.
   ADVANTAGE - By adjusting the covariance matrix for the changed uncertainty, the uncertainty of an overall pose estimation can be reduced and the pose estimation for the vehicle can be accurately calculated. The estimate and covariance matrixes can be reinitialized to eliminate any accumulated error, when the vehicle is stationary.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are included for the following:
   (1) a computer system; and
   (2) a vehicle.

AB    NOVELTY - Preventing and treating atypical osteoporosis with normal or elevated mineralization of the bone tissue with the presence of cavity formations in the trabecular sections of the bones (and similar conditions in the event of excess mass and metabolic syndrome), comprises administering drone brood and vitamin or vitamin D and/or their active metabolites.
   USE - The method is useful for preventing and treating atypical osteoporosis with normal or elevated mineralization of the bone tissue with the presence of cavity formations in the trabecular sections of the bones (and similar conditions in the event of excess mass and metabolic syndrome) in an organism (claimed). Test details are described but no results given.
   ADVANTAGE - The method utilizes the formulation that is synergistic and facilitates redistribution of calcium in the organism, reduces the mineralization of soft tissues vessels and other organs, fills cavities in the trabecular bone, allows uniform recovery of bone mineral density and facilitates increased remodeling of bone lesions and retention of bone by maintaining androgen levels.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a formulation comprising the drone brood and vitamin or vitamin D, and/or their active metabolites.
TF TECHNOLOGY FOCUS - PHARMACEUTICALS - Preferred Method: The drone brood and vitamin or vitamin D and/or their active metabolites are administered simultaneously within 24 hour period.
   ACTIVITY - Osteopathic.
   MECHANISM OF ACTION - None given.
   ADMINISTRATION - Administration of the formulation is in the form of powder, tablet or capsule. Dosage of drone brood is 10-1000 mg/day and vitamin or vitamin D and/or their active metabolites is 50-100000 IU/day (claimed), by any suitable route.

AB    NOVELTY - The method involves receiving user input specifying a geographic region of interest. A master image of the geographic region of interest, and a representation of overhead images (125) is output for display in response to the user input, where the overhead images correspond to the geographic region of interest. The selected overhead image superimposed over a geographically-corresponding portion of the master image is responded to user selection of one of the representations of the overhead images by outputting for the display.
   USE - Computer-implemented method for providing an overhead image browsing user interface to search, brows, and order overhead imagery e.g. static images, still-frame or freeze-frame images from video, videos, or images captured by satellites, for geographers, researchers, meteorologists, scientists, map service providers, government agencies, and amateur photography enthusiasts. Can also be used for airplanes, helicopters, drones, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), and balloons.
   ADVANTAGE - The method allows users to seamlessly browse overhead images in context while browsing a map and select the overhead image to view detailed information and/or to purchase by dynamically retrieving and providing the overhead images corresponding to a currently displayed geographic region of the interest, by displaying the selected overhead image overlaid on and contextually blended with the geographic region associated with the overhead image and by automatically re-centering the displayed map when the users return to main view so as to allow the user to continuously view and select overhead images while remaining in the context of a map display of the geographic region of interest.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included for the following:
   (1) an interactive system for overhead image browsing
   (2) a non-transitory computer storage including a set of instructions to perform a method for providing an overhead image browsing user interface.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a screenshot of a user interface that enables a user to browse overhead images for a geographic region of interest and to select images for detailed viewing.

AB    NOVELTY - The cover (30) defines a first aperture (36), a second aperture (38), a third aperture (42) and a fourth aperture (46). The first aperture allows passage of the pipe bag when the cover is being fitted to and removed from the pipe bag. The second aperture admits the chanter of the pipe bag when the pipe bag is fitted such that at least part of the chanter extends outside the cover. The fourth aperture admits the drones of the pipe bag when the pipe bag is fitted such that at least part of each drone extends outside the cover.
   USE - Cover for pipe bag of bagpipes (claimed), such as Greater Highland bagpipes.
   ADVANTAGE - Usage of the cover requires no removal of the chanter, the blowpipe and the drones before the cover is fitted or removed. The provision of a single aperture, i.e. the fourth aperture in contrast with the provision of an aperture for each drone obviates the need to remove the components of the bagpipes, providing for ease of fitting or removal of the cover. Retention of the chanter, the blowpipe and the drones in place on the bagpipes while the cover is filled or removed reduces the likelihood of the sound quality of the bagpipes being compromised by damage to the reeds or on account of the effect of the environmental change on the reeds.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The third aperture admits the blowpipe of the pipe bag when the pipe bag is fitted such that at least part of the blowpipe extends outside the cover.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing is an explanatory view which shows a cover configured to cover the pipe bag of Greater Highland bagpipes.

AB    NOVELTY - The drone has a telemetric sensor (154) that is ready to consider a distance relative to separation of the drone from a surface from echoes returning from ultrasonic impulses emitted by the drone. An altitude determination unit (134) includes a barometric sensor (156), and an estimator (152). An obstacle detecting unit analyzes the echoes to deduce presence of configuration of an obstacle and applies a corrective action to compensate the effect of the obstacle at the relative distance estimated by the telemetric sensor.
   USE - Rotary wing drone.
   ADVANTAGE - The obstacle detecting unit analyzes the echoes to deduce presence of configuration of the obstacle and applies the corrective action to compensate the effect of the obstacle at the relative distance estimated by the telemetric sensor, thus ensuring a continuous and reliable measurement of the altitude of the drone without disturbing feedback loops controlling stabilization of the drone.

A digital camera (16) receives light from the target and converts the received light into a light signal. A processor has a non-transitory memory for processing the radar reflection signal and the light signal to generate an image of the target, which is a function of the radar reflection signal and the light signal and executes the instructions.
   USE - Synthetic aperture radar scanning system i.e. scanner such as imaging or modeling device for use in indoor and/or outdoor application. Uses include but are not limited to a surface structure such as wall hanging, cabinet, floor, ceiling and furniture, subsurface structure e.g. framing, wiring, piping, ducting, and wall sheathing fastener, junction box, hydrant, switch, electrical outlet and register, room of a building, vehicle such as parcel delivery, pickup, food delivery, taxi, law enforcement, emergency assistance, telephone service and TV service vehicle, unmanned aerial vehicle e.g. unmanned airborne vehicle, aircraft and drones, roadway, signs, boom, tripod and pole use by a surveyor for surveying a zone, surface and subsurface object such as person and apparatus, for mapping, modeling, inspecting, planning, referencing, positioning, construction and/or real estate sales situations.
   ADVANTAGE - The processor processes the radar reflection signal and the light signal to generate an image of the target, which is the function of the radar reflection signal and the light signal and executes the instructions in order to save time and costs for measurements.

GA 2013N44223
AB    NOVELTY - The method involves providing reception antennas (32A-32C) on a platform (12) to receive an electromagnetic signal, and receiving electromagnetic illuminations by each antenna. A phase difference between the illuminations is measured. Path assumptions (H1, H2) of electromagnetic transmitters (14A, 14B) are selected relative to the platform. An expected phase difference between the antennas is calculated for selected illumination. Path assumptions of the transmitters are validated based on variations between the measured and expected phase differences.
   USE - Method for detecting and passive tracking of an electromagnetic transmitter e.g. radar, external to a platform. Uses include but are not limited to a flying vehicle such as an aircraft, drone and/or spacecraft, terrestrial or naval vehicle such as a ship, fixed carrier and fixed object such as mast.
   ADVANTAGE - The method enables tracking the electromagnetic transmitters in an accurate manner. The method enables simply locating a position and/or trajectory of the transmitters located around the platform without need to emit an electromagnetic signal for remote location of the transmitters.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a passive tracking assembly for electromagnetic transmitters external to a platform.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a schematic partial perspective view of a platform in an environment comprising transmitters illuminating a platform.

AB    NOVELTY - Producing maize plants, maize cobs and/or maize kernels with reduced fungal infestation, comprises (i) providing the maize plants, maize cobs and/or maize kernels, (ii) testing the maize plants, maize cobs and/or maize kernels for at least two volatile organic substances consisting of longifolene, alpha -selinene, beta -selinene, a sesquiterpene with a Kovats index of 1442, a sesquiterpene with a Kovats index of 1445, beta -bisabolene and beta -macrocarpene, (iii) treating the fungal infestation, and (iv) separating out infested maize plants, maize cobs and/or maize kernels.
   USE - The method is useful for producing maize plants, maize cobs and/or maize kernels with reduced fungal infestation, which is caused by Fusarium spp., preferably a fungus consisting of Fusarium graminearum, Fusarium verticillioides (preferred), and Fusarium subglutinans (all claimed).
   ADVANTAGE - The method allows rapid, reliable and economical production of the maize plants, cobs and/or kernels with reduced fungal infestation in an environmentally-friendly manner.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - Producing maize plants, maize cobs and/or maize kernels with reduced fungal infestation, comprises (i) providing the maize plants, maize cobs and/or maize kernels, where the maize plants have to reach at least one growth stage of biological research centre for agriculture and forestry, the federal office of plant varieties and chemical industry (BBCH) and coding 65, and the BBCH-65 is characterized by a bloom of upper and lower panicle branches and completely pushed grain threads, (ii) testing the maize plants, maize cobs and/or maize kernels for at least two volatile organic substances consisting of longifolene, alpha -selinene, beta -selinene, a sesquiterpene with a Kovats index of 1442, a sesquiterpene with a Kovats index of 1445, beta -bisabolene and beta -macrocarpene, where the presence of the volatile organic substances indicates a fungal infestation, (iii) treating the fungal infestation, and (iv) separating out infested maize plants, maize cobs and/or maize kernels. INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are included for:
   (1) identifying fungal infestation in the maize plants, maize cobs and/or maize kernels, comprising the step (ii) as per above se;
   (2) a system for testing maize plants, maize cobs and/or maize kernels for the volatile organic substances, comprising a measuring device that is calibrated for the two volatile organic substances consisting of longifolene, alpha -selinene, beta -selinene, a sesquiterpene with a Kovats index of 1442, a sesquiterpene with a Kovats index of 1445, beta -bisabolene and beta -macrocarpene; and
   (3) use of a calibration solution.
TF TECHNOLOGY FOCUS - BIOLOGY - Preferred Method: The maize plants, cobs and/or kernels in the step (i) are provided in batches or in a continuous process, where the maize plants, cobs and/or kernels in the step (ii) are tested in a batch-wise manner or in a continuous process. The treating step comprises separating the contaminated and non-contaminated maize plants, cobs and/or kernels in a batch-wise manner in which the respective volatile organic substances are detected/not detected, or the treating step comprises continuously separating the fungus-infected and non-infested maize plants, cobs and/or kernels. The step of separating the fungus-infected and non-infected maize plants, cobs and/or kernels is carried out by an agricultural machine, preferably a harvesting machine. The testing step is carried out by sucking air from the environment (headspace) of the maize plants, maize cobs and/or maize kernels in the measuring device and the air is tested for the volatile organic substances. The maize plants, maize cobs and/or maize kernels are tested on beta -selinene and beta -macrocarpene.
   TECHNOLOGY FOCUS - INSTRUMENTATION AND TESTING - Preferred Components: The measuring device is used to test the volatile organic substances, and consists of gas chromatography, gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometer, ion mobility spectrometer, high-field ion mobility spectrometer with asymmetric waveform, electro-chemical sensors, electrochemical sensor arrays, colorimetric sensors, and electronic noses. The system is mounted on the agricultural machine or a mobile drone, and is designed such that a sampling takes place in the vicinity of the maize cobs. The system is further mounted in a sorting system that sorts the maize plants, cobs and/or kernels. The measuring device transmits measuring signals to a control element that controls the sorting machine so that the maize plants, cobs and/or kernels are separated with and without fungus. The system further comprises a calibration unit including the calibration solution, where the calibration solution comprises a mixture of volatile organic substances, and the system automatically accesses the calibration solution to automatically perform calibration processes at appropriate intervals.
   EXAMPLE - No suitable example given.

AB    NOVELTY - The antenna has a panel comprising a network of distribution wave guides coupled with radiating wave guides (26) that include radiating elements (27) with double-circular polarization direction. A microwave switch (30) includes microwave outputs (34, 35) respectively connected to upper and lower input/output ports of the radiating wave guide through an upper part (50) and a lower part (51) of the distribution wave guide. A control input (33) controls position (1, 2) of the switch and switches a microwave input (31) of the switch on the output according to circular polarization direction.
   USE - Planar antenna for an airborne terminal onboard of aircraft, helicopter or a drone and a satellite communication system (all claimed).
   ADVANTAGE - The antenna possesses better output. The radiating elements are adapted to directly radiate in double-circular polarization without addition of a polarizing grid. The antenna allows change of polarization direction without dissymmetry of operation and switching of a beam to another beam irrespective of the polarization direction of the beams. The configuration of the antenna possesses radio frequency performances, directivity and gain and increases density of energy radiated by the antenna without increasing size of the antenna.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a schematic view illustrating flow of supply signal between a microwave frequency switch and radiating wave guide for circular polarization in direction.

AB    NOVELTY - The structure (10) has a pod door assembly integrally provided with a pod housing (30) and includes pod doors and seal door mechanism assemblies, where the structure is optimized in kinematic operational combination of the doors and seal door mechanism assemblies controlling ejection launch envelopes. The seal door mechanism assemblies operationally linked to the pod doors provide, in an open position, a clearance independence such that no trapped deployable stores occurs within the pod structure if a store ejector device fails to deploy a deployable store coupled to the store ejector device.
   USE - Pod structure for internal placement of deployable stores e.g. missile, aerodynamic missile, air to air missile, aerial bomb, air to ground bomb, extended range air to ground bomb, small diameter bomb, miniature aerial vehicle, unmanned aerial vehicle, drone, joint standoff weapon, joint standoff missile, micro-satellite, multi-payload airborne store comprising expendable electronic counter measure dispenser and tactical reconnaissance assembly (all claimed) through configuration and optimal kinematic operation of a pod door assembly for use on centerline pylon on a multirole twin-engine fighter aerial vehicle e.g. stealth and military aircraft, and mid-board pylons on an aerial vehicle. Can also be used for military aerial vehicles e.g. combat aircraft and attack helicopters.
   ADVANTAGE - The structure minimizes or reduces radar signature and induced aerodynamic drag, and is optimized for internal placement of deployable stores through configuration and optimal kinematic operation of a pod door assembly. The structure can accommodate different store configurations while maintaining the clearance independence to adjacent aircraft surfaces, adjacent deployable stores and take-off/landing ground lines.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The deployable stores is selected from group consisting of a missile, an aerodynamic missile, an air-to-air missile, an aerial bomb, an air-to-ground bomb, an extended range air-to-ground bomb, a small diameter bomb, a miniature aerial vehicle, an unmanned aerial vehicle, a drone, a joint standoff weapon, a joint standoff missile, a micro-satellite, a multi-payload airborne store comprising an expendable electronic counter measure dispenser and a tactical reconnaissance assembly.

A tie locator (130) operably coupled to the control system, where the control system determines the tie position data based on measurements from the tie locator. The tie position data includes tie configuration data, where the tie configuration data includes data regarding a profile of a tie plate (5).
   USE - Drone tampers vehicle for performing maintenance on a railroad.
   ADVANTAGE - The control system is automated, so that cost associated with operators is greatly reduced, and a lead vehicle and a drone increase a production rate of an operation over dual or triple headed machines, so that the lead vehicle and the drone can be allowed for efficient and better quality work to be performed on wood and ties that are closely spaced and skewed. The vehicle is independent, and a design of the vehicle is simpler than a dual or triple work head vehicle, so that manufacturing and maintenance cost is reduced. The lead vehicle is unable to complete the operation, so that the tie is not properly attached to a rail, and the tie can be identified, and workers can manipulate a respective tie prior to work-heads of the drone positioned over the respective tie, thus allowing drone workheads to complete the operation. The vehicle has working components of the lead vehicle and the drone that are identical, so that a number of parts required in inventory is reduced, and service time is decreased.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The vehicle utilizes a drone vehicle to operate without a direct human control. The vehicle utilizes a drone tie locator that is a metal detector device. The tie plate is a metal plate. The work head includes an anchor squeezer and tamper.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a side view of a drone tamper.

AB    NOVELTY - The method involves receiving an encoded real-time video data stream. An interruption i.e. corrupted data sequence, is detected in an encoded video data stream by decoding and reading the encoded video data stream. An encoded curative data sequence is inserted into the encoded video data stream to repair the interruption, where the encoded curative data sequence includes a data sequence or operation resulting in a display of an area of a blank screen. A network-based encoded video data stream is transmitted in a part over a radio frequency (RF) data link (10).
   USE - Method for conditioning an interruption encoded real-time video data stream over a RF data link in a wired computer network i.e. internet, for a vehicle e.g. car, lorry, train, helicopter, airplane, space shuttle, rocket, missile, drone aircraft and satellite, a video camera e.g. professional grade camera and personal video camera, an encoder, a RF transmitter, a RF transmitted signal, an RF receiver, a video conditioner, a router, a computer network, a software/hardware decoder and a blank screen/message display. Can also be used for a local area network (LAN), campus area network (CAN), backbone network, metropolitan area network (MAN), wide area network (WAN), enterprise network and a virtual private network.
   ADVANTAGE - The method enables inserting curative data to provide a continuous uninterrupted real-time video data stream that allows a viewer to view the video data stream without crashing a decoder software application or inducing hardware failure.

AB    NOVELTY - The apparatus has two input terminals including respective input voltages relative to a reference e.g. circuit ground. Two load terminals of a load include respective load voltages relative to the reference. Two current sensing elements are connected between the respective input terminals and load terminals, where first sense voltage is determined by a relationship between the first input voltage and the second load voltage and second sense voltage is determined by a relationship between the second input voltage and the first load voltage.
   USE - Electrical apparatus for sensing current through a load e.g. moving coil/moving magnet transducer coupled to bass reflex enclosure and moving coil/moving magnet transducer coupled to waveguide enclosure (all claimed), of a loudspeaker in an audio reproduction system.
   ADVANTAGE - The apparatus allows bass reflex loudspeakers to utilize sound from rear of a transducer diaphragm in addition to sound from front of a diaphragm to increase the efficiency of the apparatus at low frequencies. The apparatus allows synthesized positive output impedance of an audio power amplifier i.e. switching amplifier, to reduce drone excursion and to be lossless. The apparatus allows the audio reproduction system to increase synthesized positive impedance by using negative current feedback to flatten frequency response of a sound pressure output of the loudspeaker around secondary resonance and to reduce displacement of the drone in an improved manner when the drone is more easily overdriven at the secondary resonant frequency than at other frequencies and when displacement of the drone's moving parts exceed maximum intended displacement and materials of the drone are deformed beyond design targets to eliminate undesirable noises or damage of the drone, thus improving reliability of the apparatus without affecting the apparatus efficiency since no real power is dissipated in a physical impedance and allowing drone damping control without use of a power dissipating element using a feedback system if parameters of the transducer and secondary resonant system vary either due to production tolerances or aging over time.

TI Making improved strength carbon nanotube yarn used in e.g. sporting goods involves surface-activating unspun yarn via atmospheric pressure plasma to produce open bonds, infusing nano-resin into all voids, tightening the fibers and curing.
AU CARLSON L E
AE UNIV CALIFORNIA (REGC-C)
GA 2013L35893
AB    NOVELTY - Making improved strength carbon nanotube (CNT) yarn involves surface-activating unspun CNT yarn via atmospheric pressure plasma to produce open bonds in CNT walls contained in yarn, infusing surface-activated CNT yarn with nano-resin that penetrates void spaces between individual CNTs contained in unspun yarn, tightening CNT fibers contained in resin-infused yarn via spinning yarn under tension or applying pressure, and curing yarn to cross-link and chemically bond the nano-resin to surface-activated CNT walls to physically bond the individual CNTs to each other.
   USE - For making improved strength carbon nanotube yarn or tows, useful as structural components (claimed) in producing performance enhancements in various commercial products such as sporting goods (bats, arrows, hockey sticks, golf shafts and heads), aerospace products (struts, cowls, optic mounts, fuselage, solar sails, antennas and drone structures), and vehicle armor.
   ADVANTAGE - The low-viscosity nano-resin is completely infused into the void spaces between adjacent carbon nanotube (CNT) yarns, to fill the spaces while undergoing a curing process that results in greatly enhanced strength CNT yarns and sheets and the composite materials in which they are used. The enhanced strength CNT yarns produced have substantial improvements in load strength, tensile strength and elastic modulus, together with related improvements in mechanical properties and performance for CNT-polymer composites made from the CNT yarns.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - Making improved strength carbon nanotube (CNT) yarn comprises utilizing an unspun CNT yarn comprising continuous strands of CNT fibers held together and capable of being drawn under tension through a continuous strength-enhancing process, involves surface-activating the unspun CNT yarn via atmospheric pressure plasma to produce open bonds in the CNT walls contained in the yarn, infusing the surface-activated CNT yarn with a nano-resin that penetrates the void spaces between the individual CNTs contained in the unspun yarn, tightening the CNT fibers contained in the resin-infused yarn via spinning the yarn under tension or applying pressure to consolidate the yarn under tension, and curing the yarn to cross-link and chemically bond the nano-resin to the surface-activated CNT walls to physically bond the individual CNTs to each other, to yield an enhanced strength CNT yarn, where the nano-resin infused in the CNT yarn comprises a dicyclopentadiene (DCPD) material, cyclopentadiene (CPD)/DCPD material, or other similar nano-resin material that is polymerizable and has an uncured viscosity (at room temperature) near that of water. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for an improved CNT yarn which has been plasma-activated to produce open bonds in the CNT walls contained in the yarn and which has been infused with a nano-resin that penetrates the open spaces between the individual CNTs of the yarn and cross-links and chemically bonds to the CNT walls, in combination with functionalizing with a norbornene-containing material or other functionalizing molecule, to physically bond the individual CNT yarns to each other, where the enhanced strength yarn has load strength of at least 1.55N, tensile strength of at least 900 MPa and elastic modulus of at least 62 GPa.
TF TECHNOLOGY FOCUS - POLYMERS - Preferred Method: The infused nano-resin is polymerized by a ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) process. The CNT yarn is functionalized by norbornene or other functionalizing molecule to enhance bonding with receptors for the infusing nano-resin. The array of the CNT yarns that have been resin-infused and bonded to one another are subsequently surface-activated and functionalized to provide open polymer bonds for subsequent infusion with a different infusing polymer. The surface-activated yarn is atmospheric pressure plasma-treated. The resin-infused yarn is post-twisted, prior to curing, by spinning and pulling it through a die under tension to enhance load and tensile strength. The CNT yarn is infused with DCPD or CPD/DCPD material and/or norbornene in a wet process in combination with pulsing means to penetrate the voids between the individual CNT walls of the yarn. The infusion step is carried out with pulsed vacuum-assisted resin transfer molding (VARTM), sonic, or ultrasonic vibration techniques, to penetrate the nano-resin into the void spaces between the CNTs that form the yarn; at above 150 degrees C to increase the amount of the smaller CPD. The resin-infused yarn is mechanically flat-rolled, and in which the yarn is infused in its flat form followed by curing under tension on a heated roll. The infusion step includes cross-linking of the carbon and the nano-resin in the presence of a norbornene-containing material or other functionalizing molecule in combination with ring-opening metathesis polymerization of the nano-resin. The CNT yarns that have been resin-infused and bonded to one another are subsequently surface-activated and functionalized to provide open polymer bonds as receptors for subsequent infusion with a different infusing polymer; and including the step of subsequent infusion with a different infusing polymer for bonding to the receptors provided by the open polymer bonds. The CNT yarn is functionalized by norbornene or other functionalizing molecule to enhance bonding with receptors for the infusing nano-resin. The CNT fibers contained in the resin-infused yarn are consolidated under tension and/or applied pressure prior to curing the resin to bond the CNTs to each other. Preferred Components: The infusing nano-resin comprises norbornene. The infusing nano-resin has an uncured viscosity of below 100 cP, ringed monomer size of less than 100 nm, and ringed monomer size of 0.6-2 nm. An array of the resin-infused and bonded CNT yarns have been surface-treated by plasma and functionalized to provide open bonds adapted for infusion with a different infusing polymer.

AB    NOVELTY - The method involves selecting a predefined exposure mode that is defined by a set of parameters. The set of parameters is allowed to describe a trajectory (38) that is to be transmitted to a rotary wing drone (10) i.e. quadricopter. The parameters are allowed belong to a specific group e.g. displacement speed group. A set of setpoint values is generated from the set of parameters. The setpoint values are applied to a processing subsystem for controlling motors of the drone. A video camera (14) is activated once the drone is stabilized on the trajectory conforming to the parameters.
   USE - Method for controlling a rotary wing drone i.e. quadricopter, to perform photography by an on-board camera.
   ADVANTAGE - The video camera is activated once the drone is stabilized on the trajectory conforming to the parameters, thus avoiding oscillations inherent in a servocontrol with a feedback loop. The method produces a sequence of video images with minimized undesirable movements reflected in the image. The method minimizes stray movements of the camera. The method allows the drone to be immobilized and stabilized automatically in a fixed position without any intervention from the user.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a perspective view illustrating movement of a video camera, where movement is transmitted to the drone to produce an exposure in sideways tracking mode.

AB    NOVELTY - The method involves computing a relative angular orientation of a drone (10) with respect to a remote control apparatus (16) from two orientation data. A global reference frame (36) of the apparatus is realigned on a reference frame of the drone by application to piloting commands of rotation so as to produce realigned setpoint values according to a pitch and roll axes of the drone. The pitch and roll axes are a function of the inclinations applied to the apparatus by a user with respect to a local reference frame linked to the apparatus.
   USE - Method for intuitive piloting of a drone such as quadricopter.
   ADVANTAGE - The global reference frame of the apparatus is realigned on the reference frame of the drone by application to piloting commands of the rotation so as to produce realigned setpoint values according to the pitch and roll axes of the drone, so that the method enables intuitive piloting of the drone in an easy and spontaneous manner.

AB    NOVELTY - The inertial sensor has a mass portion (130) provided underneath a central portion (113) of a membrane (110). A post (140) is provided underneath a peripheral portion (115) of the membrane. A cap (150) is provided with a peripheral portion (155) bonded to a lower surface of the post using low-temperature silicon direct bonding. The bonding is made by subjecting the cap's peripheral portion and lower surface of the post to reactive ion etching and exposure to deionized water. The two surfaces are brought to close contact with each other so as to be mutually bonded.
   USE - Inertial sensors. Uses include but are not limited to steady shot camcorders, motion sensing for mobile phones, game machines, vehicle products such as airbags, electronic stability control (ESC), black boxes and navigation tools for vehicles, military applications such as artificial satellites, missiles, drones, etc.
   ADVANTAGE - The cap is bonded in uniform manner with respect to the post by low-temperature silicon direct bonding so that generation of driving and sensing errors due to adhesive not being formed to a uniform thickness is avoided, and generation of voids are prevented. The bonding strength is improved as dry etching which enables the molecules to be mutually coupled by Van der Waals force is performed. The process time of the sensor is reduced to improve the productivity of the sensor.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for inertial sensor manufacturing method.

AB    NOVELTY - The method involves identifying the scenario parameters (36) of a weapon system, and reducing a global representation (42) of the weapon system to a representation (46a,46b,46c,46d), adapted to an indicator (24a,24b,24c,24d), based on the determined scenario parameters. The indicator is determined based on the reduced representation. A position or location of weapon system is provided in the scenario parameters relative to a target to be taken. The global representation approximates a branch of a parameter space from the scenario parameters.
   USE - Method for determining an indicator for the striking probability of a weapon system (Claimed), such as a fighter aircraft, combat helicopter, military vehicle, land vehicle, water vehicle, drone, tank or ship.
   ADVANTAGE - The global representation of the weapon system is reduced to a representation adapted to an indicator based on the determined scenario parameters, where a position or location of the weapon system is provided in the scenario parameters relative to a target to be taken, and hence enhances striking probability and provides consistent display to operator, and ensures improved indicator determination method that allows efficient and optimized copying of the representation in real time and constructing the representation in a simple manner.

AB    NOVELTY - The method involves calculating a rolling command (42) of an aircraft using an angular variation between a line passing by a given point and an aircraft, and alignment direction. Stored wind speed (Vw-mem) is obtained from a wind speed calculated from values of two speeds (Vair, Vsol), where one of the speeds is equal to aircraft speed relative to a reference frame linked to ground, and the other speed is equal to air speed relative to surrounding air. The values are taken into account simultaneously in a prior moment or a moment during which the aircraft begins at an alignment phase.
   USE - Aircraft guidance method for correcting deviation of trajectory of an aircraft e.g. airplane, helicopter or drone, due to presence of wind, using a satellite navigation system.
   ADVANTAGE - The stored wind speed is obtained from the wind speed calculated from values of the speeds, where one of the speeds is equal to aircraft speed relative to the reference frame linked to ground, and the other speed is equal to air speed relative to surrounding air and the two values are taken into account simultaneously in the prior moment or moment during which the aircraft begins at the alignment phase so as to ensure correction of the trajectory of the aircraft in presence of the wind in an inexpensive manner while assuring guidance of the aircraft in an automatic manner.

AB    NOVELTY - The head (300) has a transmission module (310) for selecting one of antennas (311, 312) that is more suitable for transmitting and/or receiving a signal. A filtering module (320) isolates a receiving function to transmit the signal or isolates a transmitting function for receiving the signal. An amplifying module (340) amplifies the received signal to be demodulated, or amplifies the power of the modulated signal to be transmitted. A switching module (330) switches frequency bands (B1, B2) respectively used for transmission and reception of the signal.
   USE - Head for transmitting/receiving microwave frequency in a full duplex communication system for an unmanned aerial vehicle i.e. drone (claimed). Can also be used for an aircraft, a ground vehicle, a ship, a submarine, or a space shuttle.
   ADVANTAGE - The switching module switches the frequency bands respectively used for transmission and reception of the signal, thus increasing the range of connection of communication between the ground and a drone, and hence maximizing the performances of transmission and reception of the signal while limiting losses.

AB    NOVELTY - The engine has a rotor shaft (16) defining a cavity. A turbine wheel is welded to rotor shaft at a weld. A forward bearing (18) is mounted forward of a permanent magnet generator (32) mounted to rotor shaft. An aft bearing (20) is mounted adjacent to cavity. A seal ring is mounted to rotor shaft within a groove located axially along rotor shaft between aft bearing and turbine wheel. A fastener (60) is threaded to a threaded end segment (62) of rotor shaft to axially retain the rotor shaft and to provide an axial preload along longitudinal axis.
   USE - Miniature gas turbine engine used in single usage and reusable application such as reconnaissance drones, cruise missiles, decoy and other weapon applications, including air-launched and ground-launched weapon systems. Can also be used in solid fuel rocket engine.
   ADVANTAGE - The permanent magnet generator location can provide a compact arrangement while minimizing the potential for rotor shaft misbalance since the permanent magnet generator is located between the bearings. The fastener provides an axial preload along the rotor shaft, so that the axial relationship of the rotor shaft is maintained by the fixed compressor wheel and spacers. The preload spring provides dynamic compensation for tolerance variation and undesirable axial movement during shaft rotation. The aft bearing is protected from heat transfer from the turbine section to the compressor section, so that the potential for thermal damage to the aft bearing can be minimized. Thus, the bearing life of aft bearing can be improved. Since the airflow from the compressor section and intake of the engine is prevented from passing through the aft bearing by the seal ring, so that relatively higher temperatures can be achieved in the combustion system. Thus, the engine can provide more power and/or extended vehicle range.

AB    NOVELTY - The device has a active geometric exoskeleton (1) comprising a pseudo-rhombohedral annular fairing that combines a vertical straight prism structure (6) with triangular or unspecified base, an intermediate hexagonal structure (4) and a asymmetrical bipyramid-type rhombohedral structure (9) to protect propulsion units e.g. electric motor (26), and payload by absorbing impacts. A trim correction device integrates an offset tilt mechanism of engines or rotary wing propellers or gas nozzles to collimate columns of fluidic gradients and to compensate for total induced gyroscopic moment.
   USE - Active geometric exoskeleton device for a multi-environment, multi-mode, vertical or horizontal take off and landing gyropendular piloted craft or drone with compensatory propulsion and fluidic gradient collimation moving in various physical environments. Uses include but are not limited to environments such as in land, in air, in or under sea or in space.
   ADVANTAGE - The annular fairing protects the various propulsion units and the payload by absorbing impacts, corrects the trim and reorientates trajectory of the craft upon collisions with any obstacle in the physical environment or terrain by providing the craft with upper, intermediate and lower propulsion units, and with a hollow annular vertebral structure incorporating the payload containing application functions related to various domains such as civil defense emergency including search and rescue activities, exploration, navigation, transport, and surveillance activities, detection of deposits of hydrocarbons or ores of boreholes or pump holes on land, under water or in space, supporting and stabilizing a movable, free or tethered submerged pontoon for a wind turbine or a water turbine, endovascular or intra-cavity navigation and intervention during surgery, and land, aerial, underwater or space telecommunications, and deployment of telecommunications infrastructure in free space. The design of the fairing improves the performance of the craft while reducing authorization constraints related to takeoff and in flight when the weather conditions or astrophysical are critical.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a perspective view of an active geometric exoskeleton device for a multi-environment, multi mode, vertical or horizontal take off and landing gyropendular piloted craft or drone with compensatory propulsion and fluidic gradient collimation.

AB    NOVELTY - The device has a control unit (3) for controlling a degree of freedom of a slave sensor (4) i.e. slave camera, based on targeting data (dp) i.e. position data, that is generated by a targeting device (2), where the target data is related to data captured by a master sensor (1) i.e. master camera. The master sensor includes a capturing unit to provide captured data (c). The captured data is transmitted to the targeting device that identifies position of object to be detected e.g. face (O) of the person, in the image and provides the position data to the control device.
   USE - Control device for controlling a degree of freedom e.g. positioning angle and focal distance, of a slave sensor according to generated targeting data i.e. position data, relative to data captured by a master sensor for detection of an object e.g. person's face or recognition of moving patterns. Uses include but are not limited to monitoring system, automatic radar, motion capture application, recognition drone, artificial intelligence and robotics.
   ADVANTAGE - The device controls the degree of freedom of the slave sensor according to the generated targeting data relative to the data captured by the master sensor, so that a ratio between useful data to be processed and the captured data reduces the non-useful algorithmic cost while preserving the effectiveness related to the slave sensor used during detection of the object or recognition of moving pattern, thus improving algorithmic cost-detection error rate ratio.

AB    NOVELTY - Programmed flight path is corrected with due allowance for direction of wind disturbances at drone rescue position to set angular position of drone rescue. Drone flight path to drone rescue position is formed to place drone at preset altitude to the point located at preset distance from drone rescue position and to direct the drone to its rescue position opposite that of wind disturbances. Drone system comprises drone and control board with drone rescue position interconnected via radio channel. Said control board allows defining and transmitting the following data to the drone, i.e. the direction of wind disturbances at drone rescue position, the control over angular position of the drone rescue position with allowance for direction of wind disturbances. Besides, allows independent flight control with due allowance for said data.
   USE - Aircraft engineering.
   ADVANTAGE - Higher flight safety.

AB    NOVELTY - The system (100) has a selective element placed at a predetermined location and coupled to a dispersive element (154), where the selective element modulates amplitude of light at locations in a well-defined spectral plane to produce spectrally modified light. A detector (162) receives the modified light from the selective element, where the modified light comprises an image representation of an incident light in which a spectral content is modified by the selective element in narrow-wavelength spectral bands. The spectral modification is identical for the locations in the representation.
   USE - Full-framed multi-band programmable hyper-spectral or spatial system i.e. remote sensor, for imaging chemicals or byproduct of energy production with spectral characteristics utilized for an application and on board a remote sensing vehicle e.g. reconnaissance aircraft, unmanned drone and satellite. Uses include but are not limited to methane, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and ozone utilized for military/intelligence targeting application, real-time medical imaging application, rapid transient spectral monitoring application, spectrum-based tracking application and ultra-fast spectral imaging application.
   ADVANTAGE - The system obtains the full-frame hyper spectral image without requiring an external push-broom scan of the image on the micro-mirror array so as to generate spectral/spatial information in which spectral data is properly associated with spatial data. The system allows the selected spectral bands to be programmed and reprogrammed over the entire image on millisecond timescales, thus allowing background-suppressing matched filters to be implemented at real-time video rates.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The light is a compact fluorescent lamp light. The detector is a photo detector i.e. charge-coupled device (CCD). The selective element is selected from a group consisting of a micro-shutter array, an LCD array, a programmable micro mirror array, a mask, a slit array or a spectral matched filter for a forensic signature and predetermined chemical, solid, liquid, gas, substance, biological tissue, medical abnormality or mineral type. The dispersive element is selected from a group consisting of a refraction grating, a transmission grating, a diffraction disperser, an interferometric disperser or refractive disperser.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a perspective view of a full-frame, multi-band programmable hyper-spectral or spatial system.

AB    NOVELTY - The system has an aircraft parameters monitoring module acquires and selects parameters of an aircraft, where the module transmits an alarm signal if one of the aircraft parameters is out of range. A failure monitoring module receives an error message from a failure monitoring system (150), and emits another alarm signal when the received message corresponds to a reference message. A logical alarm generator (130) is connected to the modules for emitting an alarm upon receiving one of the alarm signals. A portable device (140) relays the alarm according to a wireless communication protocol.
   USE - Alarm system for use in a failure monitoring system of an aircraft i.e. drone (all claimed), for warning a pilot of the aircraft.
   ADVANTAGE - The system allows an occurrence of a significant event such as equipment failure, to be apprehended, and allows a pilot to be informed sufficiently early in a time-saving manner, so as to facilitate quick return of the pilot or other crew member of the aircraft to the cockpit. The system allows the alarm to be emitted during the event or in anticipation of the event. The system allows release of intellectual resources for the crew members at the cockpit to face the event, and allows disappearance of the psychological barrier in the absence of a captain of the aircraft.

AB    NOVELTY - The electric power management system (100) has a PDU (116,118) connected with a power bus (112) connected to a power plant (106) and a battery (114). The PDU draws power from the plant and the battery via power bus to cause the vehicle to move at different speeds depending on one of slow and fast modes of operation. The fast mode results in higher power bus voltage due to additional voltage supplied by a battery. The PDU may be driven by a bus current according to a command liming voltage-versus-current mode. The curve has a control range having upper and lower current and voltage limits.
   USE - Electric power management system for vehicle, particularly an aircraft e.g. an unmanned drone for providing persistent stare communications or global positioning functionality, detection and location of electromagnetic interference, tactical on-station weather and communication monitoring, dynamic tasking by theater commanders, communications augmentation, bandwidth expansion, robust coverage to areas with little to no other coverage, gathering persistent and actionable intelligence in real time, jamming, jammer tracking, missile defense, battle ground and air space awareness, air space collision avoidance, and dedicated communications support.
   ADVANTAGE - Vehicle, such as aircraft, performance is enhanced since the electric power management system can provide rapid vehicle response to throttle requests. The PDU speed is not limited by the present level of power produced by the power plant, since power from the power plant is supplied to the PDU and battery in slow mode and power is supplied from the battery and power plant to the PDU in the fast mode. The command limiting curve has a control range with lower and upper current and voltage limits for increased reliability and stable control of the PDU. The upper and lower voltage limits restrict significant battery use.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a method of electric power management.

AB    NOVELTY - The aircraft has a distributed electric motor unit (GEMD) with stacked electric motor elements (Ee1-Ee8) directly connected to rotary shafts (Rp1, Rp2). Each element has a fixed stator and a moving rotor coupled to the respective shaft to transmit a mechanical power to the shaft so that a condition involving a nominal mechanical power required for propulsion and lift of the aircraft, a maximum mechanical power delivered by the element to the shaft, a power derating of the element and a number of the elements is satisfied. Rotational axes of the rotor and the shafts are coaxial to each other.
   USE - Rotary- or fixed-wing aircraft e.g. coaxial rotor helicopter or airplane. Can also be used for a drone.
   ADVANTAGE - The stacked electric motor elements of the distributed electric motor unit are directly connected to the rotary shafts, thus avoiding the need for transmission systems between the motor elements and the shafts, and hence reducing the size, weight and maintenance cost of the distributed electric motor unit, while increasing the reliability of a transmission chain. The stacked structure of the electric motor elements enables continuing the transmission of sufficient power to the rotary shafts in a safe manner by reassigning the power provided by the valid electric motor elements, in case of damage of one of the electric motor elements. The judicious dimensioning of the electric motor elements enables obtaining an optimum weight/capacity ratio. The distributed electric motor unit ensures better ballistic impact strength.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a schematic block diagram of a propulsion device for distributed propulsion on a coaxial rotor helicopter.

AB    NOVELTY - The device (D) has a processing unit (MT) arranged to determine a future trajectory of a vehicle (V) within representation of a synthesis image based on a steering angle and current speed of the vehicle for displaying the trajectory on a part of the representation. The processing unit is arranged to estimate a level of risk of intersection of the trajectory by an obstacle based on a distance separating the obstacle from the future trajectory, so that the future trajectory is displayed with a color function of the estimated risk level.
   USE - Processing device for use with a driver assistance system of a vehicle i.e. motor vehicle (all claimed) such as car, to estimate a future trajectory of the vehicle within representation of a synthesis image. Can also be used for the driver assistance system of other motor vehicles e.g. motor coach, lorry or a commercial vehicle, terrestrial or marine vehicle or aerial vehicle e.g. drone.
   ADVANTAGE - The device determines the future trajectory reflecting the intersection risk level so as to avoid overloading of the displayed image with additional information required to indicate the intersection risk level, thus allowing intuitive interpretation of the displayed images, and reducing mental effects of the driver induced by the interpretation of the displayed data.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a driver assistance system for a vehicle.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a top view of a motor vehicle equipped with a driver assistance system comprising a processing device.

AB    NOVELTY - The device (D) has a processing unit (MT) to determine a future trajectory of a vehicle (V) i.e. motor vehicle such as car, as a function of steering angle and speed of progress of the vehicle. The trajectory is broken into a part containing an obstacle, and another part is located between the vehicle and the former part. A third part is located between the former part and the latter part. The latter part and the third part are displayed with a set of aspects.
   USE - Processing device for a driver assistance system of a vehicle (all claimed) i.e. motor vehicle. Uses include but are not limited to car, coach, lorry, commercial vehicle, maritime vehicle, or air vehicle such as drone.
   ADVANTAGE - The third part is located between the other two parts, where one of the parts and the third part are displayed with the set of aspects, thus permitting a driver to instantaneously differentiate portion of future trajectory that is located upstream and downstream from a detected obstacle. The driver is not disturbed when the future trajectory crosses the obstacle. The device allows more intuitive interpretation of the image displayed, and reduces mental stress of the driver. The device avoids inaccuracy in detecting obstacles, and allows conservation of space of separation between zones of future trajectory not containing the obstacle.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a schematic top view of a motor vehicle with an assistance system comprising a processing device.

AB    NOVELTY - The device (D) has a processing unit (MT) arranged to estimate a level of risk of intersection of a future trajectory estimated by an obstacle based on distance separating the obstacle from the trajectory. The unit determines, in an image representation, a display zone representing a position in progress of the obstacle with respect to a vehicle (V). The unit instructs a display of a graphic element that is representative of the obstacle, in the display zone with a color function of the level of estimated risk.
   USE - Processing device for an assistance system used for assisting a driver of a vehicle (all claimed) e.g. car. Can also be used for a coach, a lorry or a commercial vehicle, a maritime vehicle or air vehicle such as drone.
   ADVANTAGE - The processing unit instructs the display of the graphic element that is representative of the obstacle, in the display zone with the color function of the level of estimated risk of intersection, so that the displayed image is not overloaded with information intended to indicate the level of risk of intersection and can occult other information, thus facilitating localization of the obstacles and the characterization of risks and providing intuitive interpretation for the displayed image, and hence redacting burden for the driver. The device adjusts inaccurate measurements of obstacles by a detecting unit.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The display zone is a portion of a frame surrounding the representation and a portion of a periphery of representation of the vehicle.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a schematic top view of a car equipped with an assistance system including a processing device.

AB    NOVELTY - The method involves recharging the military device (20). The recharging is performed by delivering coolant (14) to the military device to cool the electric battery (30). A mobile charging station (10b) is moved to a location of the military device before recharging by the mobile charging station. The military device is considered to rapid recharging station before recharging by the rapid charging station.
   USE - Method for recharging military device such as land combat or transportation vehicle, stationary artillery device, device carried by military personnel, such as power pack, radio, handheld computer, global positioning system and encryption devices, and component of command station including telemetry system, and non-military non-vehicular device (all claimed). Can also be used in armored personnel carrier, light armored vehicle, mine protected vehicle, self-propelled howitzer, 4 x 4 utility vehicle, command and forward observation vehicle, self-propelled mortar, self-propelled gun, tank, artillery truck, air defense command vehicle, unmanned combat vehicle e.g. drone, robot, infantry fighting vehicle, aircraft and marine vehicle, and non-military devices such as power tool, portable electronic device, video camera, uninterrupted power supply back-up system, emergency lighting, server, back-up generator, medical equipment, electric vehicle including car, truck, electric boat, ship, aircraft, electric scooter, golf cart, bicycle, etc.
   ADVANTAGE - During charging, sufficient coolant is pumped from coolant source through supply line and coolant conduit into battery, as current is supplied from high power charging source through supply line and electrical conduit to absorb a portion of the heat generated within battery and prevent battery from damage due to an undesirable rise in temperature. The onboard volume and weight of military devices are reduced as the coolant and an optional heat exchanger are external to the military devices and are applied only during charging. The military devices with electric batteries are quickly recharged using rapid recharging stations that are mobile or located at military bases. The military device allows for an efficient and safe process of internal battery stack cooling during high rate charging and provides a unique and highly effective universal thermal management system.

TI Method for compressing animated images acquired by e.g. high definition camera embarked on aerial drone, involves transmitting multiplexed encoded decimated animated image and multiplexed encoded window to remote station.
AU GUINET E
AE CASSIDIAN SAS (CASS-Non-standard)
GA 2013B60907
AB    NOVELTY - The method (100) involves acquiring an animated image (IM) (101) by an image sensor, and spatial decimation (103) of the animated image so as to obtain a lower resolution decimated animated image (IMD). The decimated animated image is encoded by an encoder (ENCIMD), and a window (F) with a region of interest is created (105). The window is encoded (109) by another encoder (ENCF). An encoded decimated animated image (IMDC) and an encoded window (FC) are multiplexed (110). The multiplexed encoded decimated animated image and multiplexed encoded window are transmitted (111) to a remote station.
   USE - Method for compressing animated images acquired by an image sensor e.g. high definition camera, embarked on a terrestrial, naval or aerial mobile vehicle (all claimed) e.g. aerial drone. Can also be used for compressing animated images acquired by an infrared sensor and an electro-optical sensor in a video monitoring application.
   ADVANTAGE - The method enables compressing the acquired images in an efficient manner, and obtaining blur effect on each of the animated images by preserving better perception of a basic scene even with space decimation going up to 1/50 or 1/100. The method enables preserving the fluidity of scrolling of the animated images for temporal decimation of an image on two images and better level of detail of the region of interest, and authorizing modification of the size of the region of interest and of a position of the region of interest at each new animated image. The method enables managing a large size of region of interest by using the space decimation, maintaining the resolution of acquired animated images by capture of instantaneous images and a constant information rate transfer. The method enables maintaining a low flow even with a great region of interest by encoding the window and utilizing the great region of interest to allow the operator to accurately visualize most of theater of operations to easily follow an object moving in the theater of operations. The method enables maintaining a constant rate by the fixed size of the window and of the decimated animated images so as to exploit a hertzian or satellite channel with fixed size in spite of the variability of size, position and number of the region of interest.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included for the following:

AB    NOVELTY - The aircraft has two spindle engine propellers, two wings and a cabin, where aerodynamic thrust of blast air of each propeller passes from an vertical flight to an horizontal flight by operating an directional flap while the cabin is not depend on rotation of the flap. The propeller resembles a cylinder whose cross-section is elliptical in shape so as to accommodate a portion of batteries, and is attached to the wing. The cabin is free to rotate about its pitch axis in the vertical flight and in the horizontal flight.
   USE - Twin-engine aircraft e.g. drone.
   ADVANTAGE - The aerodynamic thrust of blast air of the propeller passes from the vertical flight to the horizontal flight by operating the directional flap that allows swing for transition of the vertical flight to the horizontal flight, pitch control in the horizontal flight and rolling control in the horizontal flight, at same time while operating in differential way, so that the cabin is freely in rotation on its pitch axis and does not comprise an empennage, thus ensuring an simplified design for the aircraft. The aircraft ensures vertical takeoff and landing without utilizing lift devices, so that weight of the aircraft can be reduced, and the aircraft can be constructed easily. The configuration of the wing is optimized for cruise condition, so that weight, trail and wing loading can be reduced. The design of the aircraft assures consumption of less energy and low manufacturing cost.

AB    NOVELTY - The method involves receiving an audio frame containing voice data and timing data. A combined packet is generated in response to the reception of the audio frame by using the audio frame and a portion of data. The combined packet is simultaneously stored in a primary data store and a secondary data store of a data recorder (122) i.e. flight data recorder, for subsequent use in reconstructing events leading up to crash of a land vehicle, an aircraft (100) or vessel, where the audio frame and the portion of data are time synchronized to each other on the combined packet.
   USE - Method for synchronizing data e.g. data link data, flight data such as engine speed data, wing flap position data, aileron position data and ruder position data, and image/video data (all claimed), of different types on a single packet in data recorder applications for reconstructing events leading up to crash of a land vehicle e.g. commercial and recreational vehicles, an aircraft e.g. commercial jet, military aircraft, drone, ultra-light aircraft, blimp, balloon and flying wing, and a vessel e.g. boat, submarine, hovercraft. Can also be used for synchronizing audio data.
   ADVANTAGE - The method enables synchronizing data of different types on a single pocket without requiring manual or automatic data synchronization process to be performed after crash, so that data synchronization process is performed using less number of memory devices, thus achieving lower circuit complexity, higher inherent reliability and improved storage latency for performing data synchronizing process in a computationally simple manner at reduced time and cost.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a data recorder.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a top perspective view of an aircraft including a flight data recorder.

AB    NOVELTY - The system has a robotic platform e.g. small-unit unmanned ground vehicle, including a reasoner (445) querying a team member perceiver i.e. soldier perceiver (425), a weapon perceiver (430) and a team perceiver (435). The reasoner interprets team member, team formation and weapon information with the team member, weapon and team perceivers to estimate team intent based on the team member, the team formation and weapon information. The reasoner determines a directive based on the intent. A vehicle control unit (475) is in communication with the reasoner to execute the directive.
   USE - System for controlling a robotic platform e.g. unmanned vehicle such as small-unit unmanned ground vehicle for high-stress operations i.e. military operations on urban terrain (MOUT) scenario, unmanned aerial vehicle, unmanned surface vehicle and unmanned subsurface vehicle, for use as a supply carrier for a dismounted warfighter, and a tank ammunition carrier moved into a position to provide ammunition, and surveillance air vehicle drone staying in position over a battlefield to provide situational awareness, a sensor platform e.g. robot sensor, on-board sensor, non-intrusive sensor and improvised explosive device (IED) sensor, and a weapon i.e. robot weapon. Can also be used for a logistics platform.
   ADVANTAGE - The system can enable the platform to perform appropriate behavior without overt human control, where the platform is controlled without bulky and expensive operator control units (OCUs). The platform can learn tactics and appropriate behavior from human beings, continue to operate when all human beings are distracted or cognitively overloaded, and can learn from training of human beings. The platform can fully interact with and support multiple human teams. The system observes human behavior and/or team behavior and decides a set of appropriate actions without direct tasking from the human beings. The platform can perform cooperative tactical correct behavior without human interaction or cognitive burden. The robot is operated as an integrated and trained member of one of the teams and understands team mission and tactics in a dismounted mode without the need for human intervention during short-term high-intensity conflict.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a method for controlling a robotic platform.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a block diagram of a robotic platform controlling system.

AB    NOVELTY - The method involves applying individual non-servo-controlled control to motors so as to cause a rotary-wing drone to rotate about a rotation axis from an initial angular position to a predetermined intermediate angular position. The individual control is applied to the motors servo-controlled to a reference target trajectory (10) so as to finish off the rotation of the drone through one complete turn about the rotation axis progressively from the intermediate angular position with a non-zero angular velocity to a final angular position with a zero angular velocity.
   USE - Method for dynamically controlling attitude of a rotary-wing drone in a high-speed quadrocopter to automatically execute a preprogrammed roll or loop-type maneuver.
   ADVANTAGE - The individual control is applied to the motors servo-controlled to the reference target trajectory so as to finish off the rotation of the drone through one complete turn about the rotation axis progressively from the intermediate angular position with the non-zero angular velocity to the final angular position with the zero angular velocity, so that the method enables executing the maneuver through one complete revolution without the drone losing altitude between the starting instant and the ending instant of the maneuver, and performing the maneuver in a neat and accurate manner without oscillating about the final horizontal position.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a software comprising set of instructions for executing a method for dynamically controlling attitude of a rotary-wing drone to automatically execute a roll or loop-type preprogrammed-type maneuver.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a front view of a rotary-wing drone showing different stages of rotation about a rotation axis during executing a roll-type maneuver. '(Drawing includes non-English language text)'

AB    NOVELTY - The method involves mounting an imaging apparatus (28) to a body (30) of a vehicle (22) i.e. aircraft (24). A video signal that is representative of optical radiation detected from an external scene (38) is created with a camera (32) i.e. infrared camera, during travel of the vehicle, where an optical axis (56) defined by the camera is not adjustable with respect to the body of the vehicle during travel of the vehicle and restricted from angular displacement in response to vibration of the vehicle by passive stabilization via vibration isolators (36).
   USE - Method for performing imaging for a vehicle e.g. fixed-wing piloted aircraft such as jet and propeller-driven plane, pilotless remote- controlled aircraft, helicopter, drone, missile, dirigible, aerostat balloon and rocket. Can also be used for a ground vehicle e.g. car, lorry, motorcycle and tank, and a watercraft e.g. boat, submarine and carrier.
   ADVANTAGE - The method enables utilizing lower cost vehicle and video systems that take images sharply and require lesser maintenance. The method enables the video system to be installed in an easy manner and increasing life of the video system.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The optical radiation is selected from a group consisting of infrared radiation, visible light and UV radiation. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a vehicle system.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a schematic side view of a vehicle system including a vehicle and a video system with a camera defining an optical axis that is restricted from angular displacement in response to vibration of the vehicle by passive stabilization via a set of vibration isolators.

AB    NOVELTY - The freight and observation system (5) has a fleet of jet engine-powered drone aircraft (10). Each aircraft has a fixed landing gear, no windows, and a ramp (R) for carrying cargo or freight (12). The aircraft is launched from and retrieved at a separate airfield in a remote area by a catapult. Global positioning system satellites (16) enable automatic navigation of the aircraft. An energy production system utilizing solar panels (30) generates the energy needed for launching, sustaining flight, and retrieval of the aircraft.
   USE - Self-sustaining drone aircraft freight and observation system for freight transport or delivery and for observing weather conditions and emergency signals from boats, ships, or from other sources needing help.
   ADVANTAGE - The drone aircraft operates from a separate airfield in outlying or remote areas to reduce land costs and to avoid disturbing residential and business areas. Since the aircraft is designed to carry only freight or cargo, need for controlled temperatures, food, drink, attendants or bathroom facilities for humans or even animals can be omitted, greatly reducing insurance rates. Fuel payload can be reduced by launching the aircraft using a catapult such as found on existing aircraft carriers and by automating aircraft navigation. The system may include an observation component to permit the drone to observe and report on weather conditions, emergency signals from boats, ships or from other sources which need help. The system may be powered using solar panels, while the excess electricity is stored in batteries to be transported to another site, omitting need for connection to a public utility electrical grid. The transportation component of the system can be combined with the large scale energy production center of multi-acre vegetable, herb and flower production center.

AB    NOVELTY - The engine (4) has a set of combustion cylinders, where each cylinder includes a piston that slides in an alternative rectilinear motion inside the cylinder. The motion is transformed into rotation via a rod connecting the piston to a crankshaft. An end of the crankshaft comprises a momentum wheel, and another end of the crankshaft comprises a pulley that is coupled via a belt with another pulley (10) to transmit rotational movement of the crankshaft to a transmission system (11) (Incomplete specification, abstract based on available information published by the patent office).
   USE - Diesel engine for an unmanned aerial vehicle e.g. rotorcraft drone such as Orca (RTM: russian air force helicopter) type drone, used to carry payloads e.g. surveillance devices, missiles and weapons, for missions e.g. surveillance missions, or intelligence missions, or combat missions, in military or civilian operations.
   ADVANTAGE - The configuration of the diesel engine increases autonomy of flight of the drone, thus allowing the drone to fly for more than 8 hours while attenuating or absorbing vibrations or vibratory waves propagated on a structure of the drone during operation of the diesel engine, using a vibration absorption device. The design of the engine is reliable while assuring less maintenance and decreased fuel consumption, and can be produced in mass in an inexpensive manner. The arrangement of the diesel engine in the drone reduces volume size and mass of the drone.

AB    NOVELTY - The method involves generating a three-dimensional (3D) model (154) of an object i.e. blade, where the model defines a object's surface comprising a set of patches generated based on a function. The surface of the object is presented at a user interface (110) e.g. browser, in accordance with the model. A bending strip is inserted into the model of the object between two patches on the surface. An analysis is performed for the model including the bending strip and the patches. A 3D representation of the object including the result of the analysis is presented at the interface.
   USE - Method for modeling and simulating an object i.e. blade (claimed), of turbine-based energy extraction devices i.e. wind turbines, during 3D geometric design of the object. Can also be used for aircraft wings, drone wings and helicopter blades.
   ADVANTAGE - The method enables performing isogeometric analysis of blades so as to allow for more accurate and efficient numerical formulations for shell-type structures of the blade. The method enables using the same model for representing a structure of the blade to design, analyze, simulate, and manufacture the blade, and configuring the model in accordance with non-uniform rational B-splines (NURBS) and bending strips, thus enabling a designer/analyst to work in the same system throughout the process. The method enables allowing the designer to detect patch boundaries programmatically, and allowing designer to programmatically insert the bending strip without intervention by a user.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The function comprises one of a spline, a T-spline, and a non-uniform rational B-spline. INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included for the following:
   (1) a system for modeling and simulating an object
   (2) a non-transitory computer-readable medium having a set of instructions to perform a method for modeling and simulating an object.

AB    NOVELTY - The vehicle i.e. weapon (5), has a self-start launching system (4) for launching the vehicle and equipped with a driving unit comprising a launching tube (6). The tube includes a front portion (7) and a rear portion (8) connected to a water supply tank (11) that is connected to a water tube (13) with a telescopic water backflow piston (14). A water intake unit e.g. anti-return valve (20), is controlled by depression generated in the rear portion of the launching tube, and allows intake of water into the rear portion of the launching tube from an environment of the vehicle.
   USE - Underwater vehicle such as weapon i.e. submarine torpedo (claimed). Can also be used for missile, drone, countermeasure device or mine.
   ADVANTAGE - The water intake unit is controlled by depression generated in the rear portion of the tube, and allows intake of water into the rear portion from the environment of the vehicle, thus launching by self-starting the vehicle by activating the driving unit without activating the piston in an effective manner. The design of the vehicle utilizes the telescopic piston and avoids the usage of a large-sized cylinder, thus reducing size of the vehicle, and ensuring reliable mass/power ratio, compact, robustness and less maintenance of the vehicle. The launching system is easily adapted for launching any types of the underwater vehicles that are not equipped with interfaces adapted for utilization of pneumatic rammers.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The launching system is an edge-grouped or actuation-type launching system.

AB    NOVELTY - The method involves receiving data collected by a remote unmanned vehicle by a server (215). The data is identified as restricted data and public data at the server. The public data is provided to users registered by the server to receive the public data. The public data received from the server is forwarded by the users registered by the server to additional recipients with annotations added by the users registered by the server, where the server functions as a civil communication hub when forwarding messages from the users registered by the server to the additional recipients.
   USE - Method for providing public users with ongoing situational awareness data e.g. restricted data and public data, collected by a remote unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in an emergency two-way telephone communication system to provide real-time data for civil emergency notification purposes for authorities e.g. police and government operators, in handheld devices. Uses include but are not limited to a smartphone, iPad (RTM: tablet computer), laptop and a web-enabled device.
   ADVANTAGE - The method enables utilizing a skyspeakapplication that can automatically display video stills on user handheld devices and can automatically voice a message as multilingual transmission without need for the recipients to operate the devices. The method enables combining a mass notification push application and a civic-communication application so as to allow up-to-the-minute UAV aerial imagery as selected by drone ground-based commanders to be automatically transmitted to subscribed end-users via current mobile operating systems and to allow the recipients to engage others by allowing retransmission of received messages with or without registered user annotations, thus creating a civil communication hub for wider, real-time dissemination of ongoing situational awareness data. The method enables alerting people in a quick manner.

GA 2012P61636
AB    NOVELTY - The vehicle (1) has an UV light source (5) communicating with a driving unit (7) for driving the light source. The driving unit stores information indicative of an UV profile of hostile firing action and communicates the UV profile to the UV light source. A programming device includes an interface, which facilitates the communication of information indicative of the UV profile of hostile firing action from the programming device to an information storing unit e.g. memory device. A parachute (8) facilitates landing and recovery of the vehicle.
   USE - Self-propelled flying vehicle e.g. rockets such as missiles, aircraft, fixed-wing and/or rotary-wing vehicles and remote drones or aircraft, for emulating a hostile firing action i.e. launch of vehicle. Can also be used as a land-based vehicle.
   ADVANTAGE - The UV light source reduces costs of high quality live fire ammunition and develops tactics and doctrine in a controlled realistic environment. The source includes a programmable system so as to replicate sub and supersonic missiles, hostile fire indicators (HFI) and false targets. The source removes health and safety aspects associated with firing live ammunition at a friendly platform. The source allows the platform to fly an accurate baseline. The stored information indicating of the UV profile is erased from the storage device upon activation of the parachute so as to provide control of distribution of the potentially confidential profile of known hostile firing and prevent the profile from being accidentally or inadvertently distributed and/or disclosed. The vehicle includes a body portion placed above an attachment unit to a cable and places the source above the cable, thus enabling the light source to be positioned above the cable in a position with an unobstructed field of view and easily detected from a distance.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The UV light source is an array of UV LEDs. INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included for the following:
   (1) a system for adapting a self-propelled flying vehicle to emulate hostile firing action
   (2) a method for adapting a self-propelled flying vehicle to emulate hostile firing action.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a cross-sectional view of a rocket to emulate hostile firing action.

TI Acoustic velocimeter for determining relative speed of aircraft e.g. military aircraft, relative to mass of ambient air surrounding aircraft, has sensors attached to aircraft at positions to receive acoustic waves emitted by generators.
AU SCHEGERIN R
AE AER (AERA-Non-standard)
GA 2012P61683
AB    NOVELTY - The device i.e. acoustic velocimeter has acoustic wave generators (G1, G2) fixed to a surface of a mobile body i.e. aircraft (1) at positions (CG1, CG2) such that acoustic waves are emitted to a mass of ambient air. Sensors (C1, C2) are attached to the aircraft at positions (CC1, CC2) to receive the acoustic waves. A measurement unit measures the time elapsed between transmission of the acoustic waves by the generators and reception of the acoustic waves by the sensors, where an angle formed between the positions of the generators and the sensors is greater than 4 degrees.
   USE - Device i.e. acoustic velocimeter for determining relative speed of a mobile body i.e. aircraft (claimed) e.g. commercial aircraft, military aircraft and drone, relative to a mass of ambient air surrounding the aircraft.
   ADVANTAGE - The velocimeter improves the accuracy and reliability of measurements of relative speed of the aircraft relative to the mass of ambient air surrounding the aircraft even in conditions of frosting and strong rain. The velocimeter allows the speed of sound in the mass of ambient air to be measured by comparing the real speed of sound with the speed of theoretical sound according to the temperature or static pressure of the ambient air, thus deducing the presence rate of water in the mass of ambient air, and hence alerting a pilot of the aircraft about the risk of icing.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a schematic side view of an aircraft integrated with an acoustic velocimeter, and representing paths of acoustic waves generated by generators when the aircraft moves at a speed of Mach 0.75.

AB    NOVELTY - The method involves continuously measuring a relative position of an aerial vehicle with respect to a surface area (100), and recording a sequence (120) of images (121, 122) of the surface area. The vehicle is moved along a flight path (110) in relation to the surface area such that the images exhibit partially overlapping image sections of the surface area in overlapping regions (123). The images of the sequence are assembled into an overall image (130) of the surface area for checking the surface area for material defects (101) and locating the defects based on the overall image.
   USE - Method for checking a surface area of a rotor blade of a wind turbine (all claimed) i.e. offshore-wind turbine, in a wind park for a material defect e.g. tear and hole, in a certain position by a near infrared camera assembly arranged on an unmanned and autonomously navigating aerial vehicle e.g. vertical take-off and landing aerial vehicle, drone and quadrotor helicopter. Can also be used for checking a surface area of a container ship, a bridge pier and a building.
   ADVANTAGE - The images of the sequence are assembled into the overall image of the surface area for checking the surface area for the defects and locating the defects based on the overall image, thus automatically checking the surface area of the rotor blade of the wind turbine for the material defects at short period of time and safety risks in an inexpensive manner.

AB    NOVELTY - A submersible vessel (430) has an elongated tubular hull (435) with a front-pulling propeller (440) mounted at the forward end. The propeller rotates only to move the hull through the water but also produce super-cavitated water, which flows from the propeller and then along the outer surface of the hull to diminish friction on the outer surface. An air skirt of super-cavitated water is formed around the hull.
   USE - Submersible vessel, such as submarine (claimed) for rapidly and covertly deploying small teams of personnel to coastline. Can also be used as an unmanned submersible craft (claimed), a torpedo, an unmanned drone, or as buoyant tubular foil of fleet protection attack craft.
   ADVANTAGE - The propeller rotates to produce an air skirt of super-cavitated water around the hull so as to lower friction on the hull outer surface, enabling the vessel to run at high underwater speeds. The propellers may be applied on the forward ends of the buoyant tubular foils of a fleet protection attack craft, providing the craft with a stable platform even when running at high speeds on substantial ocean swells so as to minimize physical stresses on the crew and to provide a stable weapons platform. The attack craft can remain on station for substantial periods of time to maintain a reliable defensive perimeter from a naval battle group or against a small boat swarm. Since the craft establishes against defensive perimeter against the small boat swarm, interception, identification, warning or even destruction of hostile boats can be realized before even approaching the battle group. The craft is also capable of stealth mode, making it difficult to detect and target, and can effectively deliver or take out small teams of special forces behind enemy lines.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a method for moving through water.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows the schematic view of a submarine with a tubular hull equipped with a front-pulling propeller to produce a super-cavitated air skirt about the hull.

AB    NOVELTY - The module (20) has two mirrors (22, 23) formed by layers of reflective material and covering opposite surfaces of a monolithic body. The monolithic body (21) includes a transmitting surface (250) by which light rays (R-L) coming from an observed scene enter into the monolithic body toward a reflection surface (220). One of the mirrors comprises an opening (24) formed by another transmitting surface (240) of the monolithic body through which light rays reflected by the other mirror leave the monolithic body.
   USE - Optical module for a panoramic vision device in an aircraft (all claimed) e.g. airplane, helicopter and drone, for a video surveillance system for monitoring interior or exterior of the aircraft.
   ADVANTAGE - The mirrors formed by the layers of the reflective material cover the opposite surfaces of the monolithic body, thus enabling preservation of relative positions of the mirrors even in the event of impact, and hence enabling preservation of field of view of a panoramic vision device without degrading the resolution of the device. The module allows the relative positioning of the mirrors to be carried out in an accurate manner by machining the monolithic body.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included for the following:
   (1) a method for manufacturing an optical module
   (2) a panoramic vision device.

AB    NOVELTY - The head (1) has a first sensor (3) and a second sensor that are mounted on an actuator so as to be turned up in first and second directions on a first line of sight (AA) and a second line of sight opposite to one another, respectively. The actuator is angularly displaced at 180 degrees to assure orientation of the second line of sight with respect to axes (410, 420) and to assure stabilization of the second line of sight, where the axes are perpendicular to each other.
   USE - Head for use in a homing device e.g. missile homing device (claimed) such as spherical window integrated missile homing device or non-spherical window integrated missile homing device. Can also be used for a drone.
   ADVANTAGE - The head is configured such that the sensors mounted on the actuator are independent from one another, so that channels of the sensors are independent from one another and optimized for the corresponding sensors, thus optimizing optical forms such as materials of lenses, fields and focal distances of the channels of the sensors for obtaining better observation of a target by the homing device. The head is compact, and can be adapted to any size of the homing device. The configuration of the head enables changing the sensors at any time i.e. before the flight or during flight of the missile. The actuator is angularly displaced at 180 degrees to assure orientation of the line of sights with respect to the axes and assure stabilization of the line of sights, thus avoiding additional cost for changing the channels of the sensors. The lines of sight are merged with each other so as to design the head in an easy manner. The configuration of the sensors enables balancing the head around the axes so as to avoid presence of unbalance.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a perspective view of a front part of a missile comprising a head.

AB    NOVELTY - The method involves receiving an acceleration signal generated by an acceleration sensor (100) that is connected to a body of a drone. A high pass filter is applied (102) to the generated acceleration signal, and peak acceleration of a filtered acceleration signal, which exceeds predetermined threshold, is detected (104). A counter is incremented (106) upon detection of the peak acceleration, and a sequence of application of double tap is validated (110) to deliver a passage marker for activating a function of start/stop/lap timing for flight of the drone.
   USE - Method for detection of external mechanical stress i.e. double tap, applied by a user to a remote controlled drone i.e. AR.Drone (RTM: quadricopter), to produce a passage marker.
   ADVANTAGE - The sequence of application of double tap is validated to deliver the passage marker for activating the function of start/stop/lap timing for the flight of the drone, thus enabling a race to be carried out simultaneously by players, without forcing the players to purchase new accessories.

AB    NOVELTY - The vehicle has a remotely controlled micro-drone i.e. biplane, provided with a fixed aerofoil and propulsion units i.e. pusher propellers(23, 24). Side wheels (25) are attached at respective side ends of a wing (18) of the fixed aerofoil, where a rotational axis of each wheel is parallel to a transverse axis (Y) of the micro-drone. Diameter of the wheel is set such that the propulsion units and the fixed aerofoil are not protruded from a cylinder defined by the wheels. The rotational axis of the wheel is located along a longitudinal axis (X) in front of center of gravity of the micro-drone.
   USE - Microscale radio-controlled aerial vehicle for carrying out remotely-operated missions or for monitoring or estimating situation inside a building. Can also be used for a nanoscale radio-controlled aerial vehicle.
   ADVANTAGE - The diameter of the wheels is set such that the propulsion units and the fixed aerofoil are not protruded from the cylinder defined by the wheels, so that the wheels can protect the structure of a mini-drone. The rotational axis of the wheel is located along the longitudinal axis in front of the center of gravity of the micro-drone, thus assuring the static stability during horizontal flight. The rotational axis of the wheel is located in the alignment of the thrust axis of the propulsion units, thus avoiding the creation of rotational moment on the vehicle when the propulsion units are under operation. The side wheels are attached at the respective side ends of the wing by simple traction on a hub, thus ensuring easy adaptation of the aerial vehicle to different missions.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a method for driving a microscale radio-controlled aerial vehicle on ground.

AB    NOVELTY - Invention relates to veterinary science. A method involves collection and homogenisation of drone larvae. Before the homogenization, drone larvae are frozen at temperature (-4; -5 degrees C) for 12-14 hours, then thawed for 3-5 minutes to +18 degrees C and packaged. Additionally, before the homogenisation and after the first freezing and thawing, the second freezing follows at temperature (-18)-(-20) degrees C for 60-72 hours accompanied by thawing at room temperature, drying at warm air flow at temperature (+55)-(+60) degrees C to remove liquid from a larva surface completely, to dry completely and sterilise at temperature (+80)-(+85) degrees C for 3.5-4.0 hours. Dry drone larvae are homogenised for 1-2 minutes, then packaged in vacuum packings. The prepared drone larva powder is added with a tylosin powder and a dimetridazole powder in the following proportions, g/kg. tylosin powder - 0.090-0.100, dimetridazole powder - 0.200-0.225, drone larva powder - the rest. The produced preparation can be stored up to two years.
   USE - Medicine.

AB    NOVELTY - The operating method involves forming a primary burn zone (82) in the combustor (80) before forming a second burn zone (84) in the combustor located downstream from the primary burn zone. Fuel and air are injected into the primary burn zone from a rotary cup surface. Fuel and air are also injected into the secondary burn zone from the second rotary cup surface.
   USE - Operating method for a gas turbine engine for an unmanned air vehicle (UAV) e.g. small cruise missile, drone.
   ADVANTAGE - The small gas turbine engine has improved operating times and low weight in order to increase the range and loiter time of the UAV. The gas turbine engine is low cost and easier to manufacture due to its low number of parts and minimal number of fuel injection points. The rotary cup combustor allows for heavy fuels to be burned in that the rotary cup combustor and provides excellent fuel break-up and large fuel passage sizes. The rotary cup is used as a fuel pump by passing the fuel through the rotary shaft and into the rotary cup, where the fuel is pumped to high pressure due to rotation of the shaft, allowing for the fuel pump to be significantly smaller, lower cost and more precise with respect to fuel metering. The igniter is located in a stagnation point between the primary burn zone and the secondary bum zone, in which the fuel is sprayed directly toward the igniter where the flow stagnation point is located, providing for the widest possible engine relight envelope.

A paint layer (28) having thickness identical to that of the film is affixed on an unmarked portion (24) of the primer layer. A decorative layer (30) with uniform thickness is formed by the film and the paint layer to entirely cover the body portion.
   USE - Method for placing a mark e.g. decoration logo, text, and figurative element, on a body portion for decoration of a high-speed terrestrial vehicle e.g. bus, car, underground train, train and tram, high-speed space vehicle e.g. aerospace vehicle, and/or high-speed nautical vehicle (all claimed) e.g. boat, motorized sailing ship, submarine or underwater exploration vehicle. Can also be used for an airliner, a helicopter or a drone.
   ADVANTAGE - The decorative layer with uniform thickness is formed by the decoration film and the paint layer to entirely cover the body portion, thus improving the flow of air on an outer envelope of the vehicle so as to avoid accelerated deterioration of the mark by stripping of the film, and hence assuring optimal protection of the mark. The uniform thickness of the decorative layer enables the decorative layer to receive a top coat having constant thickness and an outer surface without asperities. The method enables affixing the paint layer on the unmarked portion of the primer layer in a simple and rapid manner. The method enables avoiding the formation of a paint layer under the decoration film, and dissolving the paint layer during cleaning of the body portion using a scouring product, thus eliminating the need for carrying out a time-consuming and expensive scouring operation for removing the paint layer.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included for the following:
   (1) a marked body portion
   (2) a method for removing a mark used to decorate a vehicle moving at a high speed in a terrestrial, space and/or nautical environment.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a detailed sectional view of a vehicle body portion on which a top coat covering a decoration layer is deposited for defining a marked body portion.

AB    NOVELTY - The method involves generating setpoint values for a drone control loop. The setpoint values are used to control horizontal linear speed and inclination of a drone (10) relative to a reference frame associated with a ground to make the drone to follow a curvilinear path (C) at predetermined tangential speed, where the drone is a quadricopter type drone having multiple rotors. The controlling step is realized based on a command comprising right or left turn direction parameter and a setpoint defining parameter for instantaneous radius of curvature.
   USE - Method for piloting a rotary wing drone i.e. quadricopter type drone (claimed). Can also be used for piloting a single-rotor or dual-rotor helicopter.
   ADVANTAGE - The method enables controlling the drone to fly over typical turning paths of a race track around sharp curves at high speed while compensating any risks of side-slipping or oversteering by controlling the inclination of the drone, and keeping a front camera pointing in the travel direction of the drone at all times. The method enables reducing the number of degrees of freedom that a user needs to control the drone while conserving possibilities for taking fine action on the attitude of the drone.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a software comprising a set of instructions for implementing a method for piloting a rotary wing drone.

AU PETILLON J P
AE EUROCOPTER (EADS-C)
   EUROCOPTER FRANCE (EADS-C)
GA 2012L47913
AB    NOVELTY - The method involves emitting localization waves (OL1, OL2) from a reference object (1) and reflecting the waves using a reflection unit (5) situated on an object to be located (2). The waves are received and transformed into a single collected reflected signal (SRC) in an electric form. The signal is processed to extract the waves following a direct path and parasite localization waves following parasite reflectionless paths. Short propagation times of the localization waves, of respective localization signals (SL1, SL2), corresponding to the reflectionless paths, are determined.
   USE - Method for locating an object e.g. aircraft such as rotary wing aircraft e.g. helicopter drone, with respect to a reference trihedron related to a reference object i.e. decking area of a ship (all claimed). Can also be used for locating other aircraft such as fixed wing aircraft, with respect to other reference object such as terrestrial installation area.
   ADVANTAGE - The method enables locating the object in a continuous and precise manner using a single receiving antenna, during automatic guiding of the object to be located with respect to the reference object, without requiring three-dimensional, highly precise solid state elements, thus assuring landing or takeoff of the object to be located on or from the reference object in a safe and efficient manner, and hence reducing the cost required for locating the object. The method enables improving the separating capability to discriminate parasite echos and direct waves, and enables avoiding clock synchronization problems and guaranteeing excellent geometric dilution of precision when the object to be located is spaced from the reference object.

AB    NOVELTY - The method involves monitoring an operational state of a vehicle. An automated, multi-phase base station is switched from an operational state to another operational state in response to the operational state of the vehicle switching from the former operational state to another operational state, where the base station switches from an inactive state to a standby state in response to an ignition of the vehicle switching from OFF to ON, and an indication that the vehicle is parked is detected when a power takeoff of the vehicle switches from disengaged to engaged.
   USE - Method for controlling a base station mounted on a mobile vehicle. Uses include but are not limited to land-based vehicle, sea-based vehicle, air- based vehicle, police car, swat lorry, fire engine, ambulance, humvee, boats, helicopter, blimp, airplane, unmanned drone and satellites.
   ADVANTAGE - The method enables switching the base station from the former operational state to the latter operational state in response to the operational state of the vehicle switching from the former operational state to the latter operational state, so that the base station does not require a constant source of power even when the base station is not in use, thus avoiding wastage of energy. The method enables automated, multi-phase base station deployment process to enable the base station of the vehicle to support communications almost immediately upon arriving at an emergency site with minimal activity by emergency responders, so that base station deployment process is automated by controlling the base station deployment process using the operational state of the emergency vehicle on which the base station is mounted, thus preventing emergency responders from having to use critical time to perform the base station deployment process manually.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a system for controlling a base station mounted on a vehicle, comprising a base station.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a block diagram of a 911-network-on-wheels (NOW) node.

AB    NOVELTY - The method involves attaching an end of a head (5) to a body. A stop plate (6) is attached to the body at an end opposite to the head, where the head and the stop plate are an integral formed part of the body. A penetrator is driven by driving force. Width of the stop plate is maintained greater than width of the body. The force driving the penetrator and impeding the penetration of the penetrator is spread, where the driving force is provided by external mechanical unit and energy stored in mass of the penetrator.
   USE - Method for pressing a penetrator to deploy and placing penetrable items into solid or semi-solid surfaces of ground i.e. earth by utilizing a gas unit, an aircraft, a drone aircraft, a gun and a water born vehicle (all claimed), for use by military person and scientist to make measurements on Earth, planets and celestial bodies. Uses include but are not limited to weapon, instrument, air deploy supplies, animal, person, metal, plastic, wood, plant, vegetable material, water and liquid.
   ADVANTAGE - The method enables a drop vehicle with an aero stabilizer, a stop plate and a penetrator head to add extra mass at the head of drop vehicle and behind penetrator head, so as to increase ground penetration force, add aero stability by increasing nose weight of entire vehicle and assign top of drop vehicle at the ground surface in a visible manner. The drop vehicle is formed with an extended penetrator head and flattened bottom to form force distribution surface, so as to eliminate the need for usage of stop plate, so that the drop vehicle pressed on the ground surface without penetration is anchored in place by the extended penetrator head and the penetrator head barb.

GA 2012J21921
AB    NOVELTY - The method involves identifying local maximum corresponding to round trip time of a side lobe signal and local maximum corresponding to round trip time of a main lobe signal in an echo signal. An inclination angle (sigma) of a reflecting surface (2) relative to an axis and distance (d) of the surface relative to an electro-acoustic transducer (1) are calculated along another axis using the round trip times and correction parameter depending on the angle and taking into account an angular shift of the local maximum of the main lobe signal relative to emission axis of the transducer.
   USE - Method for determining distance and inclination angle of a flat reflecting surface e.g. concrete wall, metallic ship hull and seabed, relative to a reference system using a disk-like electro-acoustic transducer e.g. piezo transducer such as ultrasound ranging system, of a vehicle e.g. underwater vehicle such as autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) and remotely operated Vehicle (ROV), ground based vehicle and airborne vehicle (all claimed), for a domestic automated apparatus e.g. vacuum cleaner, robotic toy, helicopter toy and drone, and for military application. Can also be used for determining distance and inclination angle of a flat reflecting surface using a terrestrial vehicle.
   ADVANTAGE - The method enables collecting data with a single ping or a single pulse signal around single frequency, so that accuracy of collecting data is independent of motion estimate of the vehicle, thus providing less acoustic interference with acoustic devices. The method enables sector scanning sonars with shorter response time for instance at higher repetition rate. The method enables smallest size for a sensor, lowering cost of the transducer and lowering power consumption for acoustic emission.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a device for determining distanced and inclination angle of a surface relative to a reference system, comprising an electro-acoustic transducer.

AB    NOVELTY - The device has a multi-way switch (302) i.e. single-pole n-throw (SPnT) switch, implemented by a monolithically integrated micro meter- and milli meter-wave switch and realized by transistors. An active load (404) i.e. transistor circuit, is connected to an input side of the switch, and a connection circuit (405) is arranged between the load and switch. The connection circuit is moved between two states in response to a control signal so that the circuit connects the switch with the load in two ways in the states in which the load acts as active cold and hot loads for the device, respectively.
   USE - Radiometric calibration device for use in a vehicle e.g. land vehicle such as car, aircraft such as drone, and space vehicle e.g. satellite, and a robot, for ground- and space-based remote sensing, and as a body scanner for high-resolution imaging in security gates.
   ADVANTAGE - The connection circuit is moved between the two states in response to the control signal so that the circuit connects the switch with the load in the two ways in the states in which the load acts as the active cold and hot loads for the device, respectively, thus achieving cost reduction and easy assembly of the device.

GA 2012H99241
AB    NOVELTY - The system has a drone aircraft comprising sensors (2) connected to a control system, a water tank (3) and an electrically actuated water valve connected to the tank. A water outlet is connected to the valve and a control system that causes the valve to open such that water is emitted from the water tank through the outlet when the control system detects the sensors by a predetermined relative amount of increase in infrared radiation from the drone during travel over buildings. A computer memory is provided to store global positioning system (GPS) locations of buildings.
   USE - System for delivering cooling water to building top roofs.
   ADVANTAGE - The system allows a remote controlled drone aircraft to be dispatched from central location, so that the drone aircraft is focused to fly over buildings to spray or mist small amounts of water, thus cooling the roofs of target structures sufficiently, and hence saving cooling energy. The system allows half cup of water per square foot per day to reduce a building's cooling load, so that amount of water requirement is reduced. The system allows the drones to be powered with electric motors, so that the motors can pre-program routes to avoid obstacles, thus avoiding crashing into persons or parachute for flight failure.

The core structure comprises a pattern of sealed fluid pressurized cylindrically elongated cavities (20) that are filled with an incompressible fluid i.e. gas. The core structure and peripheral surfaces are formed by metal extrusion and fiber-reinforced plastic pultrusion in a constant sectional shape, and the pressurized cavities are sealed and pressurized with gas.
   USE - Lightweight impact resistant panel i.e. hollow lightweight panel, for use in an anti ballistic armor arrangement and vehicle structural body arrangement (all claimed) of a vehicle e.g. space vehicle, ground vehicle, air vehicle, and water borne vehicle such as cars, drones, airplanes satellites, tanks and ships.
   ADVANTAGE - The core structure comprises a pattern of sealed fluid pressurized cavities, thus allowing the pressure in the cavities to increase the stability of the structure against buckling, and producing the structure with high resistant against an impact. The panel is designed in such a manner that the moment of inertia of the panel is increased with reduced overall weight and an increased rigidity with thinner peripheral surfaces and with lighter or thicker core.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The panel is made of high tensile strength rigid material by an aluminum alloy extrusion.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows an isometric partial cutaway view of a hollow lightweight panel made of high tensile strength rigid material.

AB    NOVELTY - The sensor (2) has a sensitive element (6) vibrating with respect to a support (4) in primary vibration mode when the element is excited by an excitation device, and secondary vibration modes induced by Coriolis force when the sensor is displaced around a rotating axis (X), where Coriolis coupling co-efficients between the primary mode and each secondary mode are equal. One end of each of longilineal deformable protrusions (13-16) is connected to a polygonal deformable frame (10) such that each protrusion is displaced along a longitudinal axis without deformation or constraints.
   USE - Monolithic inertial sensor i.e. microelectromechanical system type triaxial Coriolis vibrating gyroscope, for measuring rotational information i.e. vehicle rotating speed, along three orthogonal axes, to guide and control a vehicle i.e. drone, for space application.
   ADVANTAGE - The Coriolis coupling co-efficients among the primary mode and the secondary modes are equal so as to allow the sensor to possess equal sensitivity to measure rotational information along three orthogonal axes, in a satisfactory manner and to allow the secondary modes to be insensitive to vibration. The configuration of the sensor facilitates encapsulation operations on a trench so as to condition the sensors in a collective manner. The configuration of the sensor enables disconnecting the sensitive element from fixation zones so as to limit loss of vibrating energy and conserve high quality factor for primary and secondary vibration modes, and hence limiting consumption of electric energy of the sensor.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a schematic perspective view of an inertial sensor.

AB    NOVELTY - The method involves acquiring and transmitting signals from a matrix detector (30) to a signal processing unit (32), and calculating subtraction signal and accumulation signal for each pixel of the detector by the processing unit. The accumulation signal for each pixel is thresholded, and an electromagnetic pulse i.e. laser pulse, is detected if the accumulation signal is greater than a preset threshold for each pixel. The electromagnetic pulse detected in an observed scene is located from coordinates of the pixel including the detected pulse.
   USE - Method for detecting a stream of electromagnetic pulses i.e. laser pulses, emitted, according to a predefined occurrence law, in a scene observed by an observer using an electromagnetic pulse detection system e.g. optronic electromagnetic pulse detection system such as infrared laser spot tracking system, laser designation pod or homing device, to guide an ammunition or a weapon such as bomb or missile, towards a target by an electromagnetic guiding device (all claimed) that is utilized in an aerial platform such as transport aircraft, combat aircraft or shooter aircraft, drone and helicopter, marine platform and terrestrial platform such as armored vehicle, troop transport, tank and infantryman.
   ADVANTAGE - The method permits efficient and reliable detection of the stream of electromagnetic pulses emitted, according to a predefined occurrence law, in the scene observed by the observer with optimized signal-to-noise ratio of the accumulation signal, without limiting integration time while assuring better precision of spatial location of the target identified by an illumination task resulting from the stream of electromagnetic pulses or direction of the target.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The subtraction signal is difference between the signals acquired during two consecutive time windows having same length. The accumulation signal is sum of the subtraction signals spaced apart in time by an interval defined by a predefined occurrence law. INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included for the following:
   (1) an electromagnetic pulse detection system comprising a subtraction signal calculating unit
   (2) an electromagnetic guiding device for guiding an ammunition towards a target, comprising an electromagnetic pulse detection system.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a schematic block diagram of an ammunition guiding system for guiding an ammunition towards a target, comprising an electromagnetic pulse detection system.

AB    NOVELTY - The apparatus has arms (120) extending laterally from a body. A rotor assembly is connected to outside end of each arm. The arms are connected to the body such that the arms are pivoted from flying position where the arms extend laterally outward from the body to allow the rotor assembly to be spaced in desired configuration to folded position where the arms are positioned parallel and adjacent to each other. A resilient clip (163) is mounted on the body or on one of the arms and provided with resilient upper and lower clip legs (167).
   USE - Rotary wing aircraft or helicopter apparatus e.g. toy and hobby device or unmanned drone, for use during surveillance.
   ADVANTAGE - The apparatus allows upper and lower rotor axes to be tilted with respect to each other and away from the arm so as to increase distance from rotor blades to the arm and decrease risk of blades of a rotor contacting the arm. The apparatus can be folded, and is compact, easy to transport and less susceptible to damage. The apparatus utilizes two forward supporting rotor arms that can be folded to lie adjacent to a rear extending arm supporting a coaxial rotor pair, so that the apparatus can be loaded into a pneumatic cannon or propulsion device and quickly launched to desired altitude in an efficient manner. The apparatus can be made to rise, descent and travel along horizontal direction without the need for complex mechanical linkages.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a perspective view of a mechanism for folding arms of an aircraft.

AB    NOVELTY - The system (1) has a trajectory generating device (2) generating a trajectory for taxiing an aircraft in an airport domain from an airport database (3). A determining unit (13) automatically determines way linking of starting and arrival points by covering polylines. A converting unit (14) automatically converts the polylines into a succession of curves forming the trajectory to be followed by the aircraft. A trajectory providing unit (15) provides the trajectory to piloting aiding units (4, 5) that use the trajectory received from the generating device for aiding piloting of the aircraft.
   USE - System for aiding piloting of an aircraft e.g. civil airplane and military airplane, taxiing on an airport domain such as an airport. Can also be used for transporting passengers or goods vehicle such as freight vehicle, and a drone i.e. pilotless aircraft.
   ADVANTAGE - The system has airport databases interpreting the information defining different constitutive elements of the airport, and displaying the information by connecting the points by straight lines so as to graphically provide surfaces or guiding lines on the aircraft elements. The system can automatically perform a connectivity test to check that the surface elements are extracted from the airport database. The system allows a trajectory to be generated followed by the aircraft when the aircraft covers the required path by taxiing so as to enable the aircraft to follow the trajectory automatically to generate a visual representation of the trajectory on an appropriate viewing position, so that the visual representation is used by the pilot for aiding the aircraft to manually guide the aircraft along the trajectory. The trajectory on the ground allows the implementation of automatic guiding of the aircraft based on the databases so as to optimize connection of the different elements of the airport, thus making generation of the running trajectory easier.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The airport database follows ED-99B standard. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a method for aiding taxiing of an aircraft on an airport domain.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a block diagram of a piloting aiding system.

TI Method for remotely detecting object or stealth craft e.g. high flying stealth aircraft, within large space, involves processing scattered portions in conjunction with path at receiver to determine change in path over time.
AU GEER J L
AE GEER J L (GEER-Individual)
GA 2012F60834
AB    NOVELTY - The method involves characterizing an electromagnetic radiation path based on a pattern of received scattered electromagnetic radiation resulting from a propagation of electromagnetic radiation through the radiation path. A set of scattered portions of a modulated electromagnetic radiation is received at a set of receiver antennas. The scattered portions are processed in conjunction with the radiation path at a receiver (140R) to determine a change in the radiation path over time.
   USE - Method for remotely detecting an object or stealth craft e.g. high flying stealth aircraft or airplane, stealth high altitude long endurance (HALE) craft or stealth satellite such as global positioning system (GPS) satellite and Iridium (RTM: satellite) satellite constellation, geosynchronous direct broadcast TV satellite, global navigation satellite system (GLONASS) satellite or personal communication satellite and commercial, government and military satellites, within a large space in commercial, government and military applications. Can also be used for helicopter, cruise missile, pilotless drone, balloon, ship, boat, submarine, tank, armored personnel carrier and car, and for a non-stealth craft.
   ADVANTAGE - The method enables detecting an attenuation of an electromagnetic wave pattern due to an obstruction of beam propagation by the object instead of detecting an echo of an electromagnetic wave reflected from the object such that stealth craft absorbing microwave radiation is made visible. The method enables using a passive negative radar such that microwave radiation is not transmitted or emanated, thus increasing difficulty of an enemy to find and destroy a microwave seeking missile.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for an apparatus for remotely detecting an object.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a perspective view of a detection and distance determination system including a pair of transmitters and a receiver.

AB    NOVELTY - The motor has a stator (S) comprising windings (B) whose ends have reversed polarities when the windings are excited. The windings are distributed around magnetized poles (P) of a rotor (R). The stator has stator modules (MS) respectively associated with the windings that create a magnetic field when the windings are traversed by current. Each module integrates an electronic management unit (3) that manages only power supply of the winding to which the module is associated. The unit is fixed on a printed circuit board (Cp) of the module. The winding is directly fixed on the circuit board.
   USE - Brushless electromagnetic motor for a terrestrial vehicle e.g. car, marine vehicle e.g. boat, submersible or torpedo, or aerial vehicle (all claimed) e.g. airplane, drone, helicopter or ultra light motorized plane. Can also be used for an electric household appliance, a ventilator, a hard disk, a compact disk (CD)-ROM drive and a radio controlled toy.
   ADVANTAGE - The windings are directly fixed on the printed circuit boards, thus reducing wiring cost, facilitating cooling of the windings, simplifying replacement of the windings in case of failure, simplifying the control of operation of the windings, and enabling easy integration of winding operation controlling sensors on the printed circuit boards. The stator modules are independent from one another, so that the stator continuously operates even if one of the modules becomes defective. The electronic management unit of each module manages only the power supply of the winding to which the module is associated, thus allowing the utilization of small size components. The motor is inexpensive to manufacture, light in weight, and reliable. The design of the stator enables increasing the motor torque, and obtaining higher power-to-weight ratio.

TI Method for transmitting commands and video stream between drone and remote control through wireless network, involves measuring quality level of upstream link from measurement of variability of intervals separating successive frames.
AU ELINE P

   PARROT (PARR-Non-standard)
GA 2012F32199
AB    NOVELTY - The method involves measuring quality level of a wireless radio link (20) i.e. upstream link, and modulating bit rate of compressed video stream emitted by a drone (10) in a direction of reduction of bit rate when an estimator indicates degradation of quality of link between the drone and a remote control (26). Control messages (ATCMB) are repeatedly emitted at constant nominal intervals. The level is measured from measurement of variability of intervals separating successive frames actually received by the drone determined from variance of the intervals on a preset number of anterior frames.
   USE - Method for transmitting commands and video stream between a drone i.e. quadricopter, and a remote control e.g. cellular telephone i.e. iPhone or portable media player with touch screen or multimedia table i.e. iPad and integrated accelerometer through a bidirectional link i.e. wireless network e.g. Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi) link conforming to IEEE802.11 standards. Can also be used for transmitting the commands and video stream between a helicopter and the remote control.
   ADVANTAGE - The method enables defining quality metric of network produced by purely software units within drone, without using a specific hardware for avoiding maximum blocking situations of reception of commands in upstream uplink caused by a flow restriction for the uplink and the video stream of the downlink, thinning control by avoiding situations that lead to a triggering of watchdog, and enabling rapid exit from the stationary state by avoiding worsening congestion when the watchdog is activated.

AB    NOVELTY - The system has a distributor (26) comprising a control unit (38) for controlling displacement of a movable closing member (36) i.e. calibrated valve, between containment and distributing positions. The control unit maintains the member in the containment position after receiving a firing order in which a pyrotechnic generator is activated for generating actuation gas. The generator is activated based on reception of another opening order independent of actuation gas applied on the closing member for moving the member from the containment position to the distribution position.
   USE - System for distributing actuation gas to a pneumatic actuator of an ejector assembly of a carriage e.g. warhead such as bomb or missile, or flying vehicle i.e. drone, carried by an aircraft (claimed).
   ADVANTAGE - The control unit remains inactive if ill-timed ignition of the charge is produced during lightning strike or electrostatic discharge, so that the movable closing member remains in the containment position to prevent the actuation gas from reaching the actuator and prevents carriage from being ejected in an uncontrolled manner, thus ensuring safety of the distribution system, while avoiding risks of damage during ground tests and risk of releasing of the carriage in uncontrolled manner during flight. The system optimizes pyrotechnic combustion by increasing pressure so as to improve energy output of the system to reduce unburned products and ensure better combustion quality, thus minimizing quantity of pyrotechnic charge placed in the generator.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a method for distributing actuation gas to a pneumatic actuator.

AB    NOVELTY - The actuator (18) has a deployable unit (26A) slidingly mounted along a sliding axis (AA') on a sliding surface (56) defined in a guiding sleeve (24) between a retracted position and an extended position. A deflecting unit (28) deflects a part of gas flow issued from an input opening (37) toward the sliding surface for plating solids in the gas flow against the sliding surface. The deflecting unit is extended from upstream of an upstream end (85A) of the deployable unit in the extended position in a partly longitudinal manner.
   USE - Pneumatic actuator e.g. multi-stage pneumatic actuator, for ejecting a load e.g. bomb, missile and flying device such as drone, carried by an aircraft.
   ADVANTAGE - The deflecting unit deflects the part of gas flow issued from the input opening toward the sliding surface in an effective manner for plating solids in the gas flow against the sliding surface. The design of the actuator ensures that the sliding surface is cleaned after deployment of the actuator, so that the mechanical performance of the actuator is constant over large number of deployments while ensuring that the actuator is utilized for 50 times without cleaning for 3 months. The design of the actuator ensures that the collected solid pollution is evacuated to an exterior of the actuator, thus limiting the global clogging of the actuator, and limiting the risk of galvanic corrosion to reduce the risk of ageing.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The deployable unit comprises a guiding annular strip (86A) that is made of solid lubrication material such as PTFE loaded with carbon or metal e.g. bronze. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a method for ejecting a load carried by an aircraft.

A pin comprises a vibration diverter and a vibration absorber. The wires are in electrical contact with the vibration diverter.
   USE - Integrated cooler i.e. cryogenic cooler, for a stirling engine of a military vehicle. Uses include but are not limited to a helicopter, drones, naval vessel and military all-terrain vehicle.
   ADVANTAGE - The expander is supported to reduce effects of a load being applied to an integrated assembly during utilization, and the electrical wires connect the infrared sensor to the CPU to reduce maximum stress applied to the wires. The cooler includes a support tube that increases stiffness of the expander to reduce effects of a shock and/or vibrations applied on the expander from the load, and reduces maximum stress encountered by the wires.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a perspective view of an integrated detector cooler assembly with an outer housing.

AB    NOVELTY - The method involves determining an external surface of a blade (10) of a wind turbine (100), and determining an interior hollow volume of the blade. A set of zones (52) on the external surface of the blade is observed by utilizing a measuring sensor. The sensor is utilized for measuring physical parameters e.g. dimensions, on points of the surface for establishing a measured chart of values of the measured physical parameter for the zones. A set of anomalies is detected by comparison of the measured values with expected values for a blade, without a noticeable defect.
   USE - Method for performing non-destructive testing of integrity of a blade of a large-sized wind turbine.
   ADVANTAGE - The set of anomalies is detected by comparison of the measured values with expected values for the blade, without a noticeable defect, thus detecting damage of the blade as soon as possible while decreasing risk of unavailability of the wind turbine for a prolonged period. The method enables simplifying control of the blade, and improving quality of maintenance by carrying out quality controls. The method allows remote observation of the blade, without contacting transmitters. The method allows precise detection of defects with reduced monitoring and maintenance costs.

GA 2012D24265
AB    NOVELTY - The device (10) has an electric field estimating unit (20) with electric sensors (21) to provide electric field measurements (mE), and a processing unit (22) to determine a field information (iE) representing electric field, from the measurements. An inertial unit (30) has inertial sensors (31) to provide inertial measurements (mC) of the solid displacement, and another processing unit (32) to determine displacement information (iC) representing the solid displacement, from the inertial measurements. A calculation unit (40) estimates a kinematic magnitude of a solid from the information.
   USE - Device for estimating a kinematic magnitude e.g. speed or position, of a solid such as pedestrian, robot or vehicle e.g. drone, at the interior of a building or in an area in which a global positioning system (GPS) presents the insufficient precision or the absence of an position information due to a weak or interfered signal.
   ADVANTAGE - The utilization of the electric sensors increases the pertinence of the estimated kinematic magnitude. The utilization of the inertial sensors assures improved performance of the device, reduces manufacturing cost of the device, and reduces the size and the consumption of the device. The inertial sensors are small in size and are energy-efficient. The device assures reliable estimation of the cinematic magnitude without depending on the disturbances of the magnetic field surrounding the solid, or the presence of the magnetic field.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The processing units are processors or microprocessors. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a method for estimating a kinematic magnitude of a solid.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a schematic view representing a device for estimating a kinematic magnitude.

AB    NOVELTY - The method involves acquiring initial measurements representing components of horizontal linear speed, inclination angles and angular speed at an initial moment. A value of decelaration time is set between initial and final moments. Setpoint values of a control loop of engines of a rotary-wing drone at a given moment are generated from a parameterized predictive function. The control loop stabilizing the drone with zero horizontal linear speed and zero slope is activated with respect to a ground when the drone attains a lifting state.
   USE - Method for controlling a rotary-wing drone i.e. quadricopter, with multiple rotors driven by engines controlled in a differentiated manner to control attitude and speed of the rotary-wing drone.
   ADVANTAGE - The setpoint values of the control loop of the engines of the rotary-wing drone at the given moment are generated from the parameterized predictive function, and the control loop stabilizing the drone with the zero horizontal linear speed and the zero slope is activated with respect to the ground when the drone attains a lifting state, thus predicting behavior and optimal angular transition of the drone with reduced time and without changing the speed or oscillation of the drone. The control loop controls angular speed, attitude and stabilization of the drone, thus allowing a user to automatically control the variations of altitude of the drone.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a graph representing speed predicted by a model, effectively measured speed, and shape of a speed curve obtained by applying a zero speed setpoint in a permanent manner on time.'(Drawing includes non-English language text)'

AB    NOVELTY - The motor has a stator (S) composed of modular stator modules (MS) that are integrated with windings (2). Electronic control units control supply of power to the windings of the stator based on an angular position of an electrically neutral rotor (R) so as to create a rotating magnetic field for rotatably driving the rotor. Each stator module is integrated with one of the electronic control units such that the supply of power to the windings is controlled in an independent manner. The electronic control unit receives signals from an angular position sensor of the rotor.
   USE - Electric motor i.e. variable reluctance motor, for a terrestrial vehicle e.g. passenger car, marine vehicle e.g. boat, submarine and torpedo, or aerial vehicle (all claimed) e.g. aircraft, drone and helicopter. Can also be used for a stepper motor and a variable inductance motor, of a household appliance.
   ADVANTAGE - The stator module is integrated with the electronic control unit such that the supply of power to the windings is controlled in an independent manner, thus enabling the operation of the motor in a continuous manner even when one of the electronic control units is failed, so as to increase the reliability of the motor, while allowing the utilization of small gauge electrical components to reduce the fabrication cost of the motor. The angular position sensor measures the angular position of the rotor so as to permit the self-control of the electronic control unit. The configuration of the motor improves the coupling between the rotor and the stator, while reducing magnetic leaks. The configuration of the motor enables easy recycling of materials utilized for forming the stator modules.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a method for operating an electric motor.

AB    NOVELTY - The method (100) involves acquiring bispectral images (102), where each bispectral image is combination of two acquired images in two different spectral bands. The images are generated (108), where each image provides an impression of depth by combining the two acquired images and forming imaging information. Specific spectrum and time signatures associated with a specific threat in the bispectral images are searched (112). A specific object in each bispectral image is detected (110). The object forming watch information is detected and tracked.
   USE - Bispectral imaging method for coordinating operations of self-defense of an air/terrestrial platform. Uses include but are not limited to airplane, helicopter, drone, and an armored tank.
   ADVANTAGE - The method allows coordinating the operations of self-defense of the air/terrestrial platform in an effective, simple and inexpensive manner. The method enables reducing number of detectors and units required to carry out required functions so as to reduce cost of integration to an air/terrestrial platform.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a bispectral imaging device.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a flow illustrating a bispectral imaging method.'(Drawing includes non-English language text)'

AB    NOVELTY - The architecture has heat exchanging elements (60) e.g. continuous section changing structures, implanted in one of elements e.g. gas ejector (16), forming an exhaust flowpath (10). The heat exchanging elements channelize hot gas stream and realize partial obstruction of the gas stream in a gas dispersive environment during traversing a portion of the stream in the exchanger elements to recover residual heat energy of exhaust gas for improving available power on a shaft (30) of a turbine engine (20) without disturbing the gas stream.
   USE - Heat-exchange architecture for use in an exhaust line of hot gas streams of a turbine engine such as turbojet engine of a helicopter and turbopropellers of aircrafts such as drones.
   ADVANTAGE - The heat exchanging elements allow recovering the residual heat energy exhaust gas so as to improve available power on the shaft of the turbine engine without disturbing the gas stream, thus optimizing performances, mass, production cost, and reducing power consumption and maintenance operation while adjusting parameters of the architecture. The configuration of the architecture allows controlling and optimizing diffusion of the gas flow by improving aerodynamic characteristics of the diffusion.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a schematic sectional view of a heat exchanging architecture with an annular exchanging element in an ejector of a turbine engine with a power take-off on a turbine shaft traversing via a reducer.

AB    NOVELTY - The method involves recovering energy by heat exchange in an exhaust conduit (70) to convert the recovered energy into mechanical energy by an independent system i.e. auxiliary turbo motor (16). The converted energy is recombined with energy provided by a turboshaft engine (1) in a single upstream zone (Z1) according to the configuration of the turboshaft engine to supply the mechanical and/or electric power according to requirements of the turboshaft engine and operation of an aircraft.
   USE - Method for recombining power provided by a turboshaft engine (claimed) of an aircraft. Can also be used for a helicopter and a drone.
   ADVANTAGE - The converted energy is recombined with the energy provided by the turboshaft engine in the single upstream zone according to the configuration of the turboshaft engine to supply the mechanical and/or electric power, so that the flexibility of integration in the architecture of the turboshaft engine is improved. The method enables reducing obstruction and mass of an energy transformation unit, and preventing the turboshaft engine from being directly affected by temperature, vibrations, and operation loads.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for an architecture of a turboshaft engine.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a cross-sectional view of a turboshaft engine architecture with an external power shaft and a speed reducer in downstream, and an independent system in upstream.

AB    NOVELTY - The vehicle (100) has a drone vehicle tie locator (30) provided in electronic communication with a drone vehicle control system. A lead vehicle control system (26) and the drone vehicle control system are structured to communicate with each other, where the lead vehicle control system provides tie position data to the drone vehicle control system. The drone vehicle control system is structured to utilize the tie position data to position the drone vehicle workhead over a portion of a tie (3), where the drone vehicle control system is structured to actuate the drone vehicle workhead.
   USE - Drone vehicle i.e. drone tamper (claimed), for use with a lead vehicle for performing maintenance on a railway system.
   ADVANTAGE - The vehicle is designed such that the control systems are automated and costs associated with operators are greatly reduced. The lead vehicle and/or drone vehicle allows production rate of the operation to be increased over the traditional dual or triple headed machines. The use of the lead vehicle and/or drone vehicle allows for more efficient and better quality work to be performed on wood or other ties, which are closely spaced or skewed. The vehicles are independent arranged, and design of the vehicles is simpler, thus reducing manufacturing and maintenance costs. The workheads between the lead vehicle and the drone vehicle can be separated for performing other operations to be conducted between the workheads. The working components of the lead vehicle and the drone vehicle can be identical, so that a number of parts required in vehicles is reduced. The vehicles perform the maintenance on a railway system in a time effective manner.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a maintenance vehicle structured to operate a railroad.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a side perspective view of a drone vehicle.

AB    NOVELTY - The method involves updating multiresolution representation of pyramid image type models of scene at different successively-decreasing resolutions. The texturing parameter representative of level of microcontrasts is obtained in picked-up scene. An approximation of the horizontal translation speed of drone (10) is obtained. A battery of predetermined criteria is applied to texturing parameter and to speed approximation. The optical-flow algorithm is switched to algorithm of corner detector type so as to estimate differential movement of scene from one image to next.
   USE - Method of evaluating horizontal translation speed of drone e.g. rotary wing drone such as helicopter and quadricopter in hovering flight under autopilot.
   ADVANTAGE - The number of successive images can be picked up optical-flow algorithm or the corner-detector algorithm, to the other algorithm such that can make return to the algorithm conditional on counting some minimum number of images. The operation of the corner detector algorithm can determine the process of current image. The algorithm based on optical flow can create pyramid of images and at the end of processing can update the old version of the pyramid of images. The corner-detector algorithm requires corners to be acquired in reduced version of the image during preprocessing. The trackers are replaced on corners before the following image. The effective compromise can be ensured between calculation time and the accuracy of the result.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a schematic view of the drone and the associated remote control appliance.

AB    NOVELTY - The method involves calculating adjustments through a processor executing a computer program product for a simulated kinetic object traveling from a defined location of a physical environment to a target (104). Result signal comprising result data (118) is conveyed to the target, where no actual kinetic object is physically conveyed from the defined location to the target within a physical environment and the result data comprises information necessary for the target to react to a kinetic object event.
   USE - Method for implementing a virtual shooter i.e. simulated kinetic weapon, to a target e.g. motorized vehicle such as car, motorcycle, tank, plane, ship and train, within a physical combat simulation environment by performing a tactical engagement simulation (TES). Can also be used for a human being, animal, drone and a robot.
   ADVANTAGE - The method enables utilizing a terrain module to provide a three dimensional map of a geographic region to permit adjustments based on terrain specific features, so that a position of the barrel of the simulated kinetic weapon is moved by an operator of the shooter to a new position immediately after a trigger pull action, thus reflecting environmental constraints in an accurate manner.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included for the following:
   (1) a global position system (GPS) augmented trajectory system
   (2) a device for implementing a virtual shooter within a physical combat simulation environment.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a schematic view of a trajectory simulation system that utilizes feedback from a target to adjust for ordinance delay and vehicle movements.

AB    NOVELTY - Cleaning up oil spills involves: e.g. a method of spotting the oil using drone helicopters (601) and planes/or jets (603), as well as using blimps (602), and by all having Global Positioning System (GPS) ability; and/or a method of skimming and collecting oil from the water surface and or under the surface, as well as a method for containing and disposing the oil using many options sizes, shapes, and styles of netting (405) along with net frames (401) which can be added to and or rigged to vessels (300) and trolled etc.
   USE - For cleaning up oil spills in a body of water such as oceans, rivers, lakes, marshes, swamps, ditches, and canals.
   ADVANTAGE - The present method and/or device is applicable for cleaning up large ocean oil spill more effectively, efficiently, and in a more environmentally friendly way than by using much of the traditional equipment, processes, and or responses. The new equipment used in the present process is capable of actually collecting more oil from the surface of the water than the traditional equipment in several different environments. The method can be rigged, be repaired, or even created entirely using materials commonly available at the shipyards, docks, and facilities within several miles of the area where the oil is being spilled. When used in any combination, the individual methods compliment each other forming a new process for cleaning up oil spills. The new processes work by themselves, and or they can work with any of the older equipment, techniques, and/or processes for cleaning oil spills. The Barge Skimmers are different sizes and/or scales so that they can be made and/or tailored for use in much area, especially shallow waters and or environmentally sensitive areas.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - A method of cleaning up oil spills consisting of several new technologies, that can be used in many combinations and with any other older or new response equipment, techniques, and or processes, and it includes:
   (A) a method of spotting the oil using drone helicopters (601) and planes/or jets (603), as well as using blimps (602), and by all having GPS ability; and/or
   (B) a method of skimming and collecting the oil from the water surface and or under the surface, as well as a method for containing and disposing the oil using many options sizes, shapes, and styles of netting (405) along with net frames (401) which can be added to and or rigged to vessels (300) and trolled, trawled, pulled, etc.; and/or
   (C) a method of skimming the oil from the water using Barge Skimmers with added and or shaped front end, intake area designed for allowing oil to be funneled into the barge through the intake while the oil is then pumped or moves in pipes/hoses from the intake to internal or external tanks, which contains the oil whereas by the natural properties of oil and water the oil rises to the top and the heavier water settles to the bottom, while having at least one drain at the bottom to let the clean water back out of the tank(s), thus creating the ability to increase oil, containment efficiency; and/or
   (D) a method for rescuing wildlife by adding mobile wildlife cleaning vessels which are in the water and can move about using their onboard cleaning stations to clean, contain, and or rescue wildlife from the oil; and/or
   (E) a method of creating a barrier in the water using air bubbles and air bubble creating equipment which can release air bubbles from under the surface of the oily water so to create a up-current which can block the oil from entering a Bay, and or it can push the oil to the water surface for better or easier skimming, and or for aiding in separation of oil from the water inside a Barge Skimmer Tank, etc.; and/or
   (F) a method of measuring the layers of oil, oil water mixed, and water inside the collection tanks of Barge Skimmers and or vessels containing oil by using the see-through oil/water checking tube, which contains a airtight cap having optional hose connected to a valve and optional pump.
   INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are included for the following
   (1) the Barge Skimmer having front end rigging or attachment connected to front of the barge, protruding from the front end, having an opening or intake area for collecting oil and or skimming oil, where the open intake area has many design options for using different types of equipment and techniques for skimming, collecting, and or suctioning the oil floating and or funneled into the intake area and then letting it move by gravity or by pumping it to area where either internal or external hoses/pipes take the skimmed oil from the intake area to the larger barge collection tank(s); internal or external pipes/hoses; large internal and or external barge collection tanks; a large deck area with the option of adding additional equipment for tailoring the Barge Skimmer for efficiency, and or to meet a desired outcomes for oil containment, in terms of concentration of oil versus water contained, as well as for the cleanliness of the water pumped overboard after collected initially, made possible by using any combination of additional equipment such as e.g. oil centrifuge equipment, vacuum pump, hoses or pipes, electric Generators, windmill aeration equipment; options of adding propulsion systems to the Barges Skimmers and or using tugboats, towboats, etc. to push or pull them through the water; option of pulling the Barge Skimmers through the water using towboat/tugboat/vessels through the water using booms that act as a funnel so to skim and or funnel a lot more oil from a much wider area into the mouth of the front end and/or intake area;
   (2) the bubble barrier system, which is a blockade to keep oil from entering certain areas of the water, for assisting in skimming, suction, and or collection operations, as well as to provide oxygen to the water in areas where a spill has occurred; and
   (3) the netting (405) and net frame (401) skimming system.

AB    NOVELTY - The assembly has a Y axis output shaft (220) rotatable about first fixed bearings (222a) as an input shaft (104) moves with a component of motion along a Y axis to capture a Y axis output. An X axis output shaft (224) is rotatable about second fixed bearings as the input shaft moves with a component of motion along an X axis to capture an X axis output. A series of linkages (230a-230c) coupled to the output shafts via pivoting joints (234) decouples Y axis movement of the input shaft from X axis movement of the input shaft, so that the X axis output is independent of the Y axis output.
   USE - Multi-axis control stick assembly for controlling a pitch and a roll in an aircraft i.e. high-speedjets. Can also be used for controlling a crane, a truck, a watercraft, a wheelchair, a surveillance camera, a remotely-controlled device such as robot and drone.
   ADVANTAGE - The Y axis output shaft and the X axis output shaft respectively receive a Y axis and an X axis input, where the inputs are precisely and accurately translated via the pivot assembly to controlled movement of the input shaft. The pivot assembly can be coupled to robotic arms and/or other output devices during robotic, computer-assisted, and robot-assisted actions to achieve specific positions with reduced backlash induced error. The pivoting joints remove the backlash from the pivot assembly, thus improving the sensitivity and accuracy of the pivot assembly outputs that are suitable for control sticks with tight angle output tolerances. The pivot assembly is enclosed by a housing to reduce or prevent external debris and/or impacts from interfering with the workings of the pivot assembly.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The bearings are journal bearings, fluid bearings, or magnetic bearings. The input shaft is a control stick for controlling aircraft pitch and aircraft roll. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a method for making a multi-axis pivot assembly.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a front isometric view of a multi-axis pivot assembly.

AB    NOVELTY - The recovery apparatus has pole pairs (104) each comprising top and bottom poles (104',104'') respectively placed near the top and bottom portions of a capture device, e.g. net (102). The pole pairs move from a first position to a second position. Energy elements, e.g. tear straps (106), are each coupled on one end to a respective top or bottom portion of the net and on another end to a respective top or bottom pole. The energy elements are disposed to absorb the force of the impact of the aircraft.
   USE - Recovery apparatus for mobile aircraft recovery system for aircraft, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), drones, and other flight devices or projectiles.
   ADVANTAGE - Mobile aircraft recovery system can be mobilized on land or on a ship deck with a single trailer and does not require the use of separate supporting structures or anchors. The small footprint of mobile aircraft recovery system allows for easy ship integration, including minimal modification and interference with current operations, also known as normal operations on the flight deck. System does not interfere with existing operational procedure and business when added to an existing ship. Mobile aircraft recovery system is able to withstand ship motion having pitch, heave and roll tolerance, as well as navigation sensitivity, and is quick and easy to both assemble and disassemble. Mobile aircraft recovery system does not require a unique configuration of aircraft due to the basket-like configuration of the net which supports a soft impact on the aircraft wings. Aircraft does not require the use of strengthening devices in the aircraft's wings to support the capture. Soft landing enabled by the mobile aircraft recovery system has a minimal impact on the aircraft weight since flight loads are the driving consideration for structural sizing. Only minor wing leading edge enhancement is required with minimal weigh impact on the aircraft. Mobile aircraft recovery system may be sized to work accurately with existing aircraft navigation systems and may be combined with a launcher assembly. Mobile aircraft recovery system is both compact and transportable, as well as reliable and durable during use, and cost efficient in both the development and production stages.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included for the following:
   (1) a mobile recovery unit; and
   (2) a recovery method for aircraft.

AB    NOVELTY - The method involves routing a cable (110) in water source, where the cable is constrained by maximum value of curvature of track in the water and by maximum value of deviation with respect to a desired water course in a terrestrial reference frame. A seismic source is displaced in the reference frame tied to the cable for emission of waves by the seismic source, where the waves are reflected by the bottom of the water source and sensed by the cable.
   USE - Method for seismic prospecting in aquatic medium e.g. sea or lake.
   ADVANTAGE - The cable is constrained by maximum value of curvature of the track in the water, thus enabling decreasing the expenditure of energy and mechanical constraints undergone by the cable. The method enables maintaining the effective length the cable during seismic measurements, thus obtaining better seismic density at reduced noise.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a seismic prospecting device comprising a cable.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a schematic view of a seismic prospecting device.

AB    NOVELTY - The method involves pressing surface of a object (3) made of diamond, hard metal, glass or ceramics, with an end portion (2) of embossing die (1) so as to form recess (4) or opening in various locations of the object corresponding to identification code of the object. The recess or opening formed in the object is tested using a standard hardness test device. The end portion of embossing die is formed in prism shape or parallelepiped shape with semi-circular cross-section.
   USE - Method for forming microgroove/nanogroove for formation of identification code in objects e.g. micro/nano gear wheel used in micro gearbox used in microsatellites and drones, medical tool insert, textile (all claimed), macroscopic tool, small polymeric tube for medical application and paper.
   ADVANTAGE - Formation of micro/nanogrooves in the object can be performed with few embossing steps by using embossing die having end portion formed in prism shape or parallelepiped shape with semi-circular cross-section. Damage to the surface area of the object can be avoided and micro/nanogrooves can be formed with high dimensional accuracy. Hence, the effort for measuring the properties of the manufactured micro/nano grooves can be reduced.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a perspective view illustrating formation of micro/nanogrooves in object using embossing die.

AB    NOVELTY - Invention relates to veterinary, in particular - to a method for preparation of a biologically active dietary supplement and a compound based thereon consisting of natural components. The method for preparation of the lyophilised biologically active dietary supplement for animals envisages collection of 9-10 days' drone larvae, their freezing, storage till usage with subsequent homogenisation; the method specificity consists in additional usage of pumpkin and distilled water. Pumpkin is peeled, cut into small pieces, frozen at a temperature of -(18-20) degrees C during 22-24 hours, defrosted to a temperature of +(17-18) degrees C during 9-11 minutes, homogenised with subsequent blending with drone larvae homogenate; drone larvae freezing proceeds at a temperature of -(18-20) degrees C while homogenisation of drone larvae and pumpkin is performed till particle size is 0.5-1.0 mm. Then, prior to packaging, the homogenate is mixed at ratio of drone larvae to pumpkin and distilled water 1:4:5; then one proceeds with lyophilic drying and sublimation, observing specific parameters of these operations performance. The compound for preparation of the lyophilised biologically active dietary supplement for animals contains drone larvae homogenate -10 wt %, pumpkin homogenate - 40 wt % and distilled water - balance.
   USE - Food industry.
   ADVANTAGE - Group of invention enabling increase of animal body weight, enhancement of their general and specific resistance, male and female reproductive function, prevention of allergic reactions and reduction of manufacture costs.

AB    NOVELTY - The method involves detecting property values for classes, and determining a qualification value of an object under consideration of each detected property value, where qualification values for two classes of classification are not equal to zero. Error values are assigned with properties, and a class conclusion force value for each class is determined under consideration of each error value. Conflict degree is derived from each property and qualified, and a total uncertainty value is formed as a product of class uncertainty values of the classes.
   USE - Method for qualifying an object such as flying object (claimed) e.g. combat aircraft, drone, cruise missile and a projectile i.e. booster rocket. Can also be used for a person and a vehicle.
   ADVANTAGE - The method enables deciding class to which the object is assigned according to uncertainty over correctness of decision.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included for the following:
   (1) a computer program product comprising a set of instructions for executing a method for qualifying an object
   (2) a memory medium comprising a set of instructions for executing a method for qualifying an object
   (3) a device for qualifying flying objects.

AB    NOVELTY - The method involves arranging an optical aberration defect correction unit i.e. correction lens (7), between a hemispherical dome shaped window (3) and a relative orientation unit (5) used for orienting an observation plane (4) with respect to a field, such that the correction unit forms an afocal optical system with the window, where the window and the lens are respectively divergent and convergent. Power and sign of the correction unit are equal and opposite to power and sign of the window.
   USE - Method for correcting aberration defects i.e. astigmatism defects, within an optical observation device (claimed) i.e. diasporometer, that is utilized for observing a field through a hemispherical dome shaped window to assure self-directional guiding of a missile, a terrestrial vehicle or a reconnaissance aircraft i.e. drone.
   ADVANTAGE - The optical aberration defect correction unit is arranged between the dome shaped window and the relative orientation unit such that the correction unit forms the afocal optical system with the window, thus correcting the aberration defects within the optical observation device immediately after their occurrence, in a simple and optical manner, and hence avoiding propagation and amplification of the defects along the observation device, while fabricating the optical observation device in an easy manner. The method enables easy integration of the optical aberration defect correction unit with the optical observation device.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for an optical device for observing a field through a dome shaped window, comprising an optical correction unit.

AB    NOVELTY - The method involves pre-determining position data of an imaging device at a planned position, and direction vector of the planned position of the imaging device at a pre-determined target point in a three-dimensional terrain model. A three dimensional reference model of the terrain model is produced such that each model elements e.g. lines, and sections of the model elements are transferred from the terrain model to the reference model. The model elements are not covered by other model elements in a vision direction of the vector and/or not found outside a visible field of the device.
   USE - Method for automatic creation of a three-dimensional reference model as terrain information for an imaging device i.e. seeker head (claimed), of an unmanned aircraft e.g. reconnaissance aircraft or drone.
   ADVANTAGE - The three dimensional reference model of the three-dimensional terrain model is produced such that each model elements and sections of the model elements are transferred from the terrain model to the reference model, and the model elements are not covered by other model elements in the vision direction of the vector and/or not found outside the visible field of the imaging device, thus enabling automatic creation of the three-dimensional reference model as terrain information in a simple, reliable and accurate manner without additional manual processing of the height data using reduced storage space and at reduced computing complexity.
   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a flow diagram illustrating the method for automatic creation of a three-dimensional reference model as terrain information.'(Drawing includes non-English language text)'
